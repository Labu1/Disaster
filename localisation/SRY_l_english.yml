sry.1.d:0 "Those were the opening words of the Syrian Congress. Held, in Damascus with the over-watch of the Hashemite "King's Militia", it was to be the greatest event in Syrian history. Secretly brought together by the King, Faisal the First, it's goal was simple. Decide on how to proceed against the French. Rida Pasha al-Rikabi, the Monarchist representative argued for pragmatic actions, kicking the French diplomatically, or with soft power. On the other spectrum was the pro-Democratic Hashim al-Atassi, who argued for military action, wishing to push all of Syria into a war mode against the French until liberation. Now the debate was growing ever heated, and slightly a bit off the hinges. The Pasha was pulling out names of diplomats that did not exist, albeit with reasonable names to convince the congress; Al-Atassi was pulling out numbers of 'sworn men' that might have went over the population of Damascus and Aleppo. In any case, the debate did reach somewhat of a conclusion. Al-Atassi agreed to fully back the efforts of Pragmatic diplomacy, if they proved to be making progress for the next five to ten years. Now this wasn't exactly groundbreaking but it was major progress for a possible independent Syria. After this grand debate, the congress went on about the King's presence, authority and many other things. Perhaps unnecessary things, because it prolonged the debate. . .and soon enough"
sry.1.a:0 "There was commotion outside."
