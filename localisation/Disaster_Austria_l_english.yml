aut.1.t:0 "The Situation of Austria in 1936"
aut.1.d:0 "Following a war strewn by hardships and military humiliation, the ancient Hapsburg Empire finally disintegrated in the Autumn of 1918. Initially, the Austrian public overwhelmingly hoped to overcome this monumental defeat through an Anschluss, or unification, with the young German republic. However, the victorious allies staunchly blocked all efforts to make the Pan-German dream a reality, and the later disintegration of Germany in 1919 made these hopes even more far-fetched. However, the young Austrian nation did have some luck, as the Italian civil war and chaos in the Balkans allowed Austrian troops to retake inland Carinthia and parts of Sudtirol. Nonetheless, Austria’s history through the 1920s was one of crippling diplomatic isolation, instability, and political violence, with an endless carousel of Conservative and Socialist governments unable to turn the country around.\n\nThis ended, however, in 1932, when the young economist Engelbert Dollfuss was appointed as Chancellor by President Miklas. Dollfuss wasted no time in implementing his Catholic and nationalist agenda. He hastily took advantage of a constitutional crisis to dissolve the Austrian parliament and crush the main part of the opposition to his government, before introducing a new authoritarian and corporatist constitution. Later surviving a socialist assassination attempt and crushing a leftist putsch by shelling large areas of workers’ housing, Dollfuss has proven that he is determined to stay in power to remodel Austria in his vision.\n\nAll is not well for Austria’s government, however. As socialist and extremist Pan-German nationalist underground movements continue to resist the regime, and with Dollfuss’s corporatist policies so far struggling to turn Austria’s economy around, time will only tell what Austria’s future will be."
