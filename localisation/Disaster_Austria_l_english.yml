### Decisions ###

AUT_state_of_emergency_decisions:0 "The State of Emergency"
AUT_state_of_emergency_decisions_desc:0 "The once unthinkable has now happened, and Engelbert Dollfuss, the man who built our nation from the ground, is dead. This sudden tragedy has thrown the country imto chaos, and the ugly beast of socialism is rearing its head once more. If we are to overcome it and save the nation, urgent action is needed.\n\n§RExlcusively using the police to resore order will strenghten Schussnigg's hand in the power struggle."
AUT_secure_vienna:0 "Secure Vienna"
AUT_secure_vienna_desc:0 "Nowhere is the chaos greater than in the capital, Vienna. Since Dollfuss died there has been constant rioting, which now threatens to escalate into revolution. Only a clear show of force can pacify this discontent before it goes too far."
AUT_heimwehr_secure_lower_austria:0 "Use the Heimwehr to restore order in Lower Austria"
AUT_heimwehr_secure_lower_austria_desc:0 "To restore order in Lower Austria, we shall use Starhemberg's own Heimwehr units, ensuring that loyalty is maintained, even if they lack the efficiency of trained police."
AUT_police_secure_lower_austria:0 "Use the Police to restore order in Lower Austria"
AUT_police_secure_lower_austria_desc:0 "To restore order in Lower Austria, we shall use the police. This is the most efficient means to bring back stability, but the police is controlled by Schussnigg, so we should be wary of becoming too dependent on them."
AUT_heimwehr_secure_upper_austria:0 "Use the Heimwehr to restore order in Upper Austria"
AUT_heimwehr_secure_upper_austria_desc:0 "To restore order in Upper Austria, we shall use Starhemberg's own Heimwehr units, ensuring that loyalty is maintained, even if they lack the efficiency of trained police."
AUT_police_secure_upper_austria:0 "Use the Police to restore order in Upper Austria"
AUT_police_secure_upper_austria_desc:0 "To restore order in Upper Austria, we shall use the police. This is the most efficient means to bring back stability, but the police is controlled by Schussnigg, so we should be wary of becoming too dependent on them."
AUT_heimwehr_secure_tyrol:0 "Use the Heimwehr to restore order in Tyrol"
AUT_heimwehr_secure_tyrol_desc:0 "To restore order in Tyrol, we shall use Starhemberg's own Heimwehr units, ensuring that loyalty is maintained, even if they lack the efficiency of trained police."
AUT_police_secure_tyrol:0 "Use the Police to restore order in Tyrol"
AUT_police_secure_tyrol_desc:0 "To restore order in Tyrol, we shall use the police. This is the most efficient means to bring back stability, but the police is controlled by Schussnigg, so we should be wary of becoming too dependent on them."
AUT_heimwehr_secure_carinthia:0 "Use the Heimwehr to restore order in Carinthia"
AUT_heimwehr_secure_carinthia_desc:0 "To restore order in Carinthia, we shall use Starhemberg's own Heimwehr units, ensuring that loyalty is maintained, even if they lack the efficiency of trained police."
AUT_police_secure_carinthia:0 "Use the Police to restore order in Carinthia"
AUT_police_secure_carinthia_desc:0 "To restore order in Carinthia, we shall use the police. This is the most efficient means to bring back stability, but the police is controlled by Schussnigg, so we should be wary of becoming too dependent on them."
AUT_socialists_regroup:0 "The socialists regroup"
AUT_socialists_regroup_desc:0 "Although we have defeated their inital attempts to take power in Vienna, the socialists still have a considerable footing across Austria. If we can't restore order around the country quickly enough, they may still be able to take over."
AUT_lift_state_of_emergency:0 "Lift the State of Emergency"
AUT_lift_state_of_emergency_desc:0 "With order having returned, we may now lift the State of Emergency that Starhemberg earlier proclaimed, restoring many rights to the people and signalling clearly that we believe the crisis has passed."
AUT_power_struggle_decisions:0 "The Power Struggle"
AUT_power_struggle_decisions_desc:0 "Dollfuss’s tragic death has left a clear power vacuum within the VF, which Kurt Schussnigg, the Minister for the Interior and a known moderate, is now seeking to exploit. He has openly challenged Starhemberg's leadership, but we are unable to purge him outright due to hisextensive influence. As such we must instead chip away more quietly at that influence, and wait for his bid for power to fizzle out."
AUT_schussnigg_fails:0 "Schussnigg runs out of momentum"
AUT_schussnigg_fails_desc:0 "Provided Schussnigg doesn't expand his influence too much, his bid for leadership will simply run out of momentum and fail if given time. However, he will surely do what he can to prevent this from happening, so we must be prepared to what is needed to keep different interest groups loyal to ourselves."

### Focuses ###

AUT_merge_the_posts:0 "Merge the Posts"
AUT_merge_the_posts_desc:0 "To fully solidify Dollfuss’s hold on power, it is now being proposed that we merge Miklas's post of Bundesprasident, the oficial head of state with his own post of Bundeskanzler. This would clearly make him the sole, unchallenged power in Austria, but we will need to tread carefully to succeed."
AUT_economic_reforms:0 "Economic Reforms"
AUT_economic_reforms_desc:0 "Despite all of our previous efforts at turning around the Austrian economy, it remains stagnant at best. In the long term this could greatly undermine the credibility of our government and policies, so we must act quickly to reinvigorate the economy."
AUT_maintain_agrarianism:0 "Maintain Agrarianism"
AUT_maintain_agrarianism_desc:0 "A man of peasant roots himself, Dollfuss has, since the start of his career, been an agrarian through and through. He has always championed the interests of the Austrian peasantry, for in them alone can be seen the true spirit of the Catholic German people. Although we need to re-energise our policies, the principles behind them need not change."
AUT_new_industrialism:0 "New Industrialism"
AUT_new_industrialism_desc:0 "Although we have always been an agrarian party, the party of the common farmer, we can no longer pretend to ourselves that these policies simply are not working. If Austria’s economy is stagnant, it is because she is completely bereft of the industry with which to compete with other nations. Only a new industrialisation drive will solve the problems we are faced with."
AUT_corporatist_ideals:0 "Corporatist Ideals"
AUT_corporatist_ideals_desc:0 "Inspired by the Quadregismo Anno and by our opposition to both socialism and liberal capitalism, corporatist ideology has always guided our economic policy. We should now look to strenghten the Corporate State in Austria, and further legally enshrine our ideals."
AUT_further_state_intervention:0 "Further State Intervention"
AUT_further_state_intervention_desc:0 "The failings of liberal nations to deal with the effects of the Depression, and indeed of previous Austrian governments to do so, make clear that only determined and precise state intervention can turn an economy around. Through increasing our spending and our investments, we should pull Austria out of the crisis in no time!"
AUT_protect_the_common_farmer:0 "Protect the Common Farmer"
AUT_protect_the_common_farmer_desc:0 "How can the honest, hardworking small farmers of this nation hope to survive in a global market, faced with unlimited competition from vast foreign businesses? If we are truly to represent the farmers of Austria, we must enact new tarriffs to ensure a market for their hard-earned produce."
AUT_grain_exports:0 "Grain Exports"
AUT_grain_exports_desc:0 "Having now strenghtened the hand of our own agriculutral sector and greatly increased our own production through the tarriffs, we can now look to exporting much larger amounts of our newly plentiful grain. It's no secret that in many a nation agriculuture has not recovered as it has here, and the abundance of buyers and potential trade deals will surely go some way to reinvigorating the economy."
AUT_aristocratic_ties:0 "Aristocratic Ties"
AUT_aristocratic_ties_desc:0 "As well as the peasantry, we have another key support base in Austria’s ancient aristocracy. Represented in our government by such figures as Prince Starhemberg, they have a great deal of influence and we would be failing ourselves if we couldn't keep them happy with our policies. As such we should meet with and reach out to key aristocrats, and seek to accomodate their demands."
AUT_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
AUT_land_reform_desc:0 "Having now secured the loyalty of the gentry, we should in return expect them to collaborate with us in finally implementing our long promised land reform projects, distributing significant amounts of land to both the State and smaller farmers. Witht the co-operation of all, Austrian agriculture will flourish like never before!"
AUT_nation_of_farmers:0 "A Nation of Farmers"
AUT_nation_of_farmers_desc:0 "With our agrarian reforms firmly in place and the loyalty of the rural population, rich and poor alike, secured, we can truly call oursleves a nation of farmers. Agriculutree is what has lifted our economy out of stagnation, and agriculture is what shall ensure future growth. And within the honourable peasantry of this nation, the true spirit of the Catholic German is seen."
AUT_farmers_to_factorymen:0 "Farmers to Factorymen"
AUT_farmers_to_factorymen_desc:0 "As we imdustrialise we will need men to work in the new factories and we can only hope to do this by promoting migration from the countryside to expanind rural areas. As agriculture loses its sway on the economy, farmers will be forced to move to the cities anyway, so we might as well encourage them to do so now."
AUT_new_export_markets:0 "New Export Markets"
AUT_new_export_markets_desc:0 "With our industrial capacity rapidly increasing, Austrian businesses are now branching out into a number of new goods, and should soon be able to compete with foreign companies. Subsidising these efforts and negotiating trade deals on their bhealf should reinvigorate our economy, and help pull us out of the erstwhile slump."
AUT_ties_with_business:0 "Ties With Business"
AUT_ties_with_business_desc:0 "As we indutrialise we will need the support of the businessmen of this country, on whom we must depend to lead the economy forwards. By meeting with prominent business representatives and giving them more sway in the government, we can ssure that their needs are accomodated and their loyalty is secured."
AUT_new_labour_charter:0 "New Labour Charter"
AUT_new_labour_charter_desc:0 "Having now secured the allegiance of business, we should expect them to fulfill their end of the bargain, integrating their companies into the larger state corporations and agreeing to a new Charter on Workers' Rights, to be signed in accordance with the leaders of our state-controlled Trade Unions. The principle of corporatism in Austria will be strenghtened like never before."
AUT_nation_of_industry:0 "A Nation of Industry"
AUT_nation_of_industry_desc:0 "With our industrial reforms now in place, and new factories sprining up around the country, we can finally proclaim that Austria is now a truly industrial nation. Our vastly enhanced production, within the asupices of the Corporate State, will lead to previously impossible levels of prosperity for all Austrians."
AUT_austrian_miracle:0 "The Austrian Miracle"
AUT_austrian_miracle_desc:0 "We have done it. With our economic reforms firmly implemented and the country pulled clean out of the depression, an economic boom has set in. As foreign investemnt soars and the standard of living skyrockets, the press proclaims this the "Austrian Miracle". And what else is it, for it is our faith in God and dedication to Him that has brought us this far."
AUT_deepen_church_ties:0 "Deepen Church Ties"
AUT_deepen_church_ties_desc:0 "Now that we have further consolidated power, we should look to further strenghtening our bonds with the only guarantor of a righteous and just government, and of a moral population - the Catholic Church. Through further meeting with the clergy, especially Cardinal Innitzer, and strenghtening the role of Catholic teachings in our law, we can solidify the Church's position in Austria and further gain their approval."
AUT_revise_the_concordat:0 "Revise the Concordat"
AUT_revise_the_concordat_desc:0 "Having signed a Concordat with the Papacy in 1934, it may now be time to review the agreemeent. If we can secure increased Church backing for education and social programs in Austria, our own position will be greatly strenghtened and the people will be benefited enormously. Meanwhile, the tacit support of the Catholic Church will further legitimise our regime."
AUT_clergy_in_the_government:0 "Clergy in the Government"
AUT_clergy_in_the_government_desc:0 "Having resolved to draw closer to the Church, we would now be well advised to reach out to the Priests of Austria, involving them more in local government, and consulting prominent clergymen on legislation. With the advice and support of men of God, Austria will be greater than ever."
AUT_promote_catholic_social_teaching:0 "Promote Catholic Social Teaching"
AUT_promote_catholic_social_teaching_desc:0 "If we are to   truly repay the trust and support of the Church, we must seek to make Austrian society truly reflect its teaching. Throughreforms to education, new family progrmas, and public information campaigns, we can begin to spread the Church's social teaching around the nation."
AUT_unite_the_youth_movements:0 "Unite the Youth Movements"
AUT_unite_the_youth_movements_desc:0 "There are already several Catholic and nationalist youth groups in Austria, such as the Heimwehr's Young Fatherland, the Ostmarkjugend, and the Christian-German Gymnastics Youth. Although these are already tied to our regime, Guido Zernatto now intends to unite them into one group, the Osterreichisches Jungvolk. This new movement will teach the youth true Catholic values, and prepare them to defend Austria."
AUT_extol_dollfuss_faith:0 "Extol Dollfuss’s Faith"
AUT_extol_dollfuss_faith_desc:0 "Before first accepting the post of Chancellor, Dollfuss prayed all night in his favourite church. His piety has long been well known, and has always earned him the respect of the public and of the Church. It is now time to take advantage of this, encouraging the populace to follow his admirable example and emulate his devotion to God."
AUT_catholic_education:0 "Catholic Education"
AUT_catholic_education_desc:0 "Having agreed on education provisions in the revised Concordat, we should now expand on this further, greatly increasing our overall funding for education while also bringing the teachings of the Church further into the curriculum. With a faithful and educated youth, Austria will truly prosper!"
AUT_a_moral_people:0 "A Moral People"
AUT_a_moral_people_desc:0 "With our pro-Catholic policies having now been in place for some time, Austrian society is changing to reflect our ideals, with a greater emphasis on Christianity and morality developing among much of the population, and the Catholic aspects of Austria’s culture becoming more prominent. We should use this to our advantage, and encourage the people to go even further for s moral Austria."
AUT_austrian_identity:0 "The Austrian Identity"
AUT_austrian_identity_desc:0 "It is absolutely vital for the survival of Austria and of our faith that we stamp out what remains of pan-Germanism, greeatly emphasising sll that sets us apart from our neighbours to the North. By evoking a new pride in AUstria's own, unique culture and history we can give rise to a new patriotism, and strenghte our own government."
AUT_catholic_nationalism:0 "Catholic Nationalism"
AUT_catholic_nationalism_desc:0 "Now that we have worked towards evoking a new national pride among the people, it is important that we place great emphasis on the Catholic elements of Austrian patriotism. To defend Austria is to defend its faith and its God: let none forget this truth."
AUT_lead_by_example:0 "Lead By Example"
AUT_lead_by_example_desc:0 "Now, more than ever, it is crucial that Dollfuss proves himself to be the most righteous leader Austria could hope for. Through further showing his own credentials as a devout Catholic and a brave patriot with a distinguished record in the great war, Dollfuss can aptly remind the people that to commit to Austria is to commit to his government."
AUT_a_moral_government:0 "A Moral Government"
AUT_a_moral_government_desc:0 "Having gone so far to promote patriotism and morality among the public, we should esnure that we ourselves aren't falling short of the standards we've set. Through routing out the inevitable corruption, treason, and decadence within the statem we can ttrly prove ourselves to the people as a fair and principled government."
AUT_mit_dollfuss_in_die_neue_zeit:0 "Mit Dollfuss in die Neue Zeit"
AUT_mit_dollfuss_in_die_neue_zeit_desc:0 "A new age is dawning over Austria. As the Church bells peel and the Heimwehr marches through the street, as the drums of the OJV beat and  the anthem sounds far and wide, it is clear to all thst Dollfuss has won. Austtria has been rebuilt in his vision and to his specifications, and nothing is left to stop him. All as it should be."
AUT_react_to_the_crisis:0 "React to the Crisis"
AUT_react_to_the_crisis_desc:0 "With Dollfuss dead, Starhemberg has already moved to proclaim a State of Emergency against the nation. It is inevitable that socialist resistance will flair up, and we must tread very carefully to ensure that it's nipped in the bud. Behind the scenes, meanwhile, there will surely be a great deal of political manouevering within the VF, with Kurt Schussnigg seeking to extend his power."
AUT_schussnigg_at_the_helm:0 "Schussnigg at the Helm"
AUT_schussnigg_at_the_helm_desc:0 "With Stahremberg's resignation, Kurt Schussnigg has been able to merge the posts of Bundeskanzler and Bundesprasident under himself, as Dollfuss had first planned to do. He will now be able to pursue his vision of a united, technocratic Austria, and we must all work with him for the glory of the nation."
AUT_emergency_investments:0 "Emergency Investments"
AUT_emergency_investments_desc:0 "The Austrian economy has been struggling for years now, and the recent crisis hardly helped. Only a new program of government spending and investemnt can stimulate it again and bring about a return to prosperiity. As such, Chancellor Schussnigg has organised widespread emergency invetments in order to pull Austria's economy firmly out of stagnation."
AUT_support_the_beureaucrats:0 "Support the Beureaucrats"
AUT_support_the_beureaucrats_desc:0 "Schussnigg's staunchest supporters over the last months have been the beuraeaucrats and administrators of the nation, attracted by his vision and promises of a meritocratic and technocratic Austrian state. We need now to repay their loyalty, and to begin building Schussnigg's ideal state. As such, we should begin reshuffling the beureaucracy to ensure that loyal and capable administrators are favoured."
AUT_suppress_the_heimwehr:0 "Suppress the Heimwehr"
AUT_suppress_the_heimwehr_desc:0 "Although Stahremberg has been forced to resign the role of Chancellor, he still holds an unsettling amount of influence through his position as leader of the Heimwehr paramilitary. To challenge this potentially dangerous organisation, we should move to demote its allies from influential posts, chip away at its official powers and privileges, and subtly discourage membership of it."
AUT_technocratic_economy:0 "Technocratic Economy"
AUT_technocratic_economy_desc:0 "With a strenghtened beureaucracy now tightening its hold of Austria under Chancellor Schussnigg, it is time to reform our corporatist economic policies to better reflect this emerging reality. By giving beureaucratic boards control of the nation's corporations and ensuring that the emerging technocracy structures the economy well, we will surely be able to pull ourselves out of the depression."
AUT_technocratic_government:0 "Technocratic Government"
AUT_technocratic_government_desc:0 "With Schussnigg increasingly empowering his supporters in the beureaucracy and striving to reform the Standestaat to meet his own vision, a new technocracy is finally emerging, with Schussnigg firmly at the centre of this change. Long live the Standestaat and long live its gallant administrators!"
AUT_guided_industrialisation:0 "Guided Industrialisation"
AUT_guided_industrialisation_desc:0 "We must recognise that, without a majort industrial capacity, the Austrian economy is doomed to perpetual stagnation. Although the agrarianism of the Dollfuss years was widely supported, the time has come to move on from such quaint ideals. Co-ordinated by the empowered beureaucracy, new industrial centres across Austria will have to be opened, alongside broader investment in industrialisation."
AUT_cult_of_efficiency:0 "Cult of Efficiency"
AUT_cult_of_efficiency_desc:0 "With the economy now well on its way to recovery, it is time to further stimulate our growth by promoting a devotion to efficient production among the industrialists and bosses within the Corporate State, encouraging competition to reach new levels of production efficiency, and greater funds and contracts in exchange. The goods will roll off the production lines like never before!"
AUT_meritocratic_state:0 "Meritocratic State"
AUT_meritocratic_state_desc:0 "If our technocracy is to survive, it must be a meritocratic one. Only the most competent beuraeaucrats and administrators will be able to guide the country forward and implement Schussnigg's vision. As such, we must constantly seek the most talented men in the administration, and favour them for promotions and opportunites regardless of their background or standing. A Christian State must be a fair state."
AUT_extent_of_reforms:0 "The Extent of Our Reforms"
AUT_extent_of_reforms_desc:0 "In recent months, Figl and his Young Guard allies have only risen in prominence, accumulating more and more influence and publicity. Meanwhile, the more conservative and authoritarian members of the government are more and more concerned about the growing reformist influence. Tensions are clearly coming to a head, and the coming weeks may settle the fate of our nation..."
AUT_establish_frontmilitz:0 "Establish the Frontmilitz"
AUT_establish_frontmilitz_desc:0 "For some time we have been repressing the Heimwehr, forcing much of its leadership out of key positions and discouraging membership. However, this has meant that the immense potential of a state paramilitary has gone to waste. As such, we should formally abolish the Heimwehr, merging it and other nominally loyal paramilitaries into a united "Frontmilitz" organisation, under a loyal leadership."
AUT_revive_nationalism:0 "Revive Austrian Nationalism"
AUT_revive_nationalism_desc:0 "The reecent bouts of instability and financial trouble have all gone some way to undermine the people's sense of pride in this nation. Lest the ugly spectre of Pan-Germanism return, we should seek to use the extensive resources propaganda and coersion resources at our disposal to reawakena sense of national pride and belonging among Austria's people. Heil Osterreich!"
AUT_beureaucratic_boom:0 "The Beureaucrats' Boom"
AUT_beureaucratic_boom_desc:0 "With the economy having by now been pulled out of the crisis, the future looks bright for Austria. Under the responsible of our extensive beuraeaucracy, the economy is reaching new heights and the goods are rolling off the lines. A boom is right around the corner, and with market confidence surging, it may be ven sooner than we think!"
AUT_the_defense_of_austria:0 "The Defense of Austria"
AUT_the_defense_of_austria_desc:0 "Regardless of how times have improved for the nation, we cannot ignore the constant dangers that surround us in the world. The world stage is only getting more and more tense, and it seems inevitable that we shall have to fight for our freedom and faith. As such, we must further invest in the Frontmilitz and military, and see better to our defences. Thus, Austria will always stand tall in the world."
AUT_christlich_deutsch_gerecht_und_frei:0 "Christlich, Deutsch, Gerecht, und Frei"
AUT_christlich_deutsch_gerecht_und_frei_desc:0 "We have done it. Although many concessions and compromises have had to be made along the way, Schussnigg's vision of a fair and technocratic corporate state has been finally realised. The climb up the mountain has been a tough one, but at last we can enjoy the beautiful view from the summit."

AUT_socialist_discotent:0 "Socialist Resistance"
AUT_socialist_discotent_desc:0 "Ever since the brief civil war in 1934, the Austrian socialist movement, dedpite being heavily oppressed and, formally, banned, has, under the leadership of Karl Renner, been a massive source of instability for our regime.

aut.1.t:0 "The Situation of Austria in 1936"
aut.1.d:0 "Following a war strewn by hardships and military humiliation, the ancient Hapsburg Empire finally disintegrated in the Autumn of 1918. Initially, the Austrian public overwhelmingly hoped to overcome this monumental defeat through an Anschluss, or unification, with the young German republic. However, the victorious allies staunchly blocked all efforts to make the Pan-German dream a reality, and the later disintegration of Germany in 1919 made these hopes even more far-fetched. However, the young Austrian nation did have some luck, as the Italian civil war and chaos in the Balkans allowed Austrian troops to retake inland Carinthia and parts of Sudtirol. Nonetheless, Austria’s history through the 1920s was one of crippling diplomatic isolation, instability, and political violence, with an endless carousel of Conservative and Socialist governments unable to turn the country around.\n\nThis ended, however, in 1932, when the young economist Engelbert Dollfuss was appointed as Chancellor by President Miklas. Dollfuss wasted no time in implementing his Catholic and nationalist agenda. He hastily took advantage of a constitutional crisis to dissolve the Austrian parliament and crush the main part of the opposition to his government, before introducing a new authoritarian and corporatist constitution. Later surviving a socialist assassination attempt and crushing a leftist putsch by shelling large areas of workers’ housing, Dollfuss has proven that he is determined to stay in power to remodel Austria in his vision.\n\nAll is not well for Austria’s government, however. As socialist and extremist Pan-German nationalist underground movements continue to resist the regime, and with Dollfuss’s corporatist policies so far struggling to turn Austria’s economy around, time will only tell what Austria’s future will be."
aut.1.a:0 "Heil Osterreich!"
aut.2.t:0 "Modifying the Constitution"
aut.2.d:0 "Today President Miklas and Chancellor Dollfuss have officially gained the cabinet's approval for the Constitutional amendment that will merge their two roles. The new post of Bundeskanzler will double as Head of Government and Head of State, and will of course be filled by Dollfuss himself. Dollfuss’s path to total domination now seems clear."
aut.2.a:0 "Excellent"
aut.3.t:0 "The Flag Question"
aut.3.d:0 "With our preparations to revise the Austrian constitution well underway, a new proposal has arisen from some members of the cabinet. They suggest that the parrty flag of the Vaterlandische Front be elevated to the status of the national flag of Austria, replacing the current eagle flag. While many sympthise with this idea, believing it would do well to symbolise Dollfuss’s new consolidation of power, many others believe that we should maintain coontinuity, keeping the flag above party politics."

aut.3.b:0 "It's an effective gesture"
aut.4.t:0 "An Alarming Report"
aut.4.d:0 "Today a most alarming report arrived on Dr. Dollfuss’s desk, from our intelligence agenices monitoring the socialist underground. It states that the rally planned to celebrate the Constitutional Amendment may be in great danger from socialist terrorists, and the life of Dollfuss himself may be at risk. What's more, it states, security provisions are deeply inadequate, making mattersd even worse. As such sme in the cabinet are now calling for the rally to be called off entirely."

aut.4.b:0 "This is too risky: postpone the rally"

Many in the police and military command are urging us to take extra precatuions in ligh of the recent report, deploying additional troops in Vienna and increasing our expenses to ensure Dollfuss’s safety. Others, however, believe we are being too anxious, and should take a calmer approach."

Many commanders are reporting their men questioning the dedication of the government, or whether the country truly is as stable as we claim. Why, they are aasking, is Dollfuss really feeling the need to hide from his own adoring people? Many are now suggesting that we go ahead with the rally to reverse these worries, but the political U-Turn could be embarrassing. Meanwhile, some are proposing that we make up for the cancellation through having Dollfuss give a major speech over the radio."

After apologising for failing to speak to them in person, and hoping that they would understand his reasoning in light of recent troubles with the radicals, he promised to use his powers to guide Austria further to economic strength and to shore up its postion in central Europe, as well as to do what he could to bring the nation closer to God."
aut.8.a:0 "Heil Dollfuss! Heil Osterreich!"
aut.9.t:0 "The Constitution is Amended"
aut.9.d:0 "Today, in a private ceremony in the Schonbrunn Palace, the Constitution of the Austrian Federal State was formally revised to merge the posts of Bundesprasident and Bundeskanzler under Engerlbert Dollfuss, essentially completing his consolidation of power. However, the fact that a planned rally to mark the event was cancelled, and that nothing was done to substitute for this, has fuelled much suspicion among the public, and much undermined our efforts to present ourselves as a confident, stable force in the country. While in time we shall surely recover, Dollfuss’s hand has for now been notably weakened."
aut.9.a:0 "Heil Dollfuss...?"
aut.10.t:0 "Dollfuss Shot!"
aut.10.d:0 "Having just ratified the constitution to merge the roles of Bundesprasident and Bundeskanzler under himself, Dollfuss proceeded to address a large rally near the Schonbrunn palace. However, shortly after he started speaking, a heavily armed group of men, presumably socialist militants, burst from the crowd and fired indiscriminately at the platform. Dollfuss was hit three times, and passed away 2 hours later, having recieved the last rites.\n\nWith the constitutional amendment rendered, for now at least, obsolete, Miklas has appointed Ernst Rudiger Stahremberg as provisional Chancellor. Stahremberg, who was Dollfuss’s right hand man throughout his life, clearly sees himself as the natural successor, and with the support of his large Heimwehr paramilitary, and of much of the army, may well come to fill Dollfuss’s shoes.\n\However, Dollfuss’s Minister for the Interior, Kurt Schussnigg, also believes himself capable of succeeding the great chancellor, and has the support of the more moderate wing of the VF, allegedly among them Miklas himself: not to mention that through his ministry he controls the police and he alone can now enforce the impending state of emergency that Stahremberg is preparing to proclaim ./n/nly time will tell who shall rise to the top..."

Signed in Rome by both Dollfuss and His Holiness, the new revised Concordat ensures Church funding and support for education and social programs in Austria, while also increasing the privileges of the Church snd its autonomy from the Austrian state and right to adjudicate on questions of Church teaching and doctrine.\n\This agreement will greatly strenghten our ties with the Church and our popularity among Austrian Catholics, and for that we are grateful."

aut.12.t:0 "The Jewish Youth Groups"
aut.12.d:0 "Having merged the nationalist and Catholic youth movements into the OJV, we are now faced with an interesting problem: that of the Jewish youth groups, notably the Betar and Hakoah.\n\nMany  in our government, including some Jews sympathetic with Dollfuss, want to see these organisations also merged into the OJV, in order to further integrate Austrian Jews into mainstream society and to ensure that they too are taught the value of patriotism. Others, however, whether out of anti-semitism or conservative Judaism, would prefer to avoid this integration of Jews into the mainstream of society, while others simply see it as unfair to bring Jewish children into a Catholic youth group. They argue that a separate Jewish Youth Association should instead be set up to accomodate them.\n\nUltimately, the choice is ours."
aut.12.a:0 "Everyone has a place in the OJV"
aut.12.b:0 "Why should Jewish children be raised according to Christian principles?"
aut.13.t:0 "Church Youth Movements"
aut.13.d:0 "Now that we have merged most of the pro-regime and Catholic youth movements into the OJV, we are now confronted with the matter of those groups which are run directly by the Church. So far we have left these groups be as a sign of goodwill to the Church, but there are now calls to integrate them as well into the OJV. The proponents of this argue that since the OJV will teavh them the same values, it only makes sense or them to have access to the greater resources of our organisation. Of course, it will also expand our own control over the country. Given the recent revision to the Concordat, now is the time to act if we are to do this, while relations with the Church are still high.\n\However, many, especially in the Clergy, call for these groups to remain separate from the OJV. They argue that the independence of the Clergy is vital to the spiritual health of the nation, and that since we ourselves have stated this many times it would be deeply hypocritical to go back on our word now.\n\Another group has also emerged, which wants us to formally merge these groups into the OJV and give the OJV oversight over them, but to also preserve much of their current autonomy, and to give Church leaders the final say on their acivites./n/Whatever our decision is to be, it must be made now."

aut.14.t:0 "Dollfuss’s Height"
aut.14.d:0 "In spite of all his works for the nation, there is one thing that, time and again in his life, has held Engelbert Dollfuss back: his height. Standing at a remarkable 4 foot 11, he had to go to great lengths to be allowed to serve in the great war. His height hs drawn attention ever since then, with many foreign commentators especially commenting on his diminutive stature In Austria, meanwhile, jokes about his height are all too popular..\n\nDollfuss himself has never minded any of this, and in fact has a reputation for enjoying - and even, at times, encouraging - jokes about his height. However, as his cult of personality grows and we further secure our power, this may become a thorn in our side. Some in the government, especially those working in propaganda, are now urging us to crack down on humour abour Dollfuss’s height and to downplay his reputation. They argue that if Dollfuss can't be respected and taken seriously be the people, our efforts to make them accepts our more controversial policies may well be in vain.\n\Dollfuss himself dismisses this idea, and holds onto the belief that only through modesty and a decent sense of humour can he maintain his reputation as a man of the people. But with calls rising for something to be done, it might be time for him to change his mind."

aut.15.t:0 "The State of Emergency"
aut.15.d:0 "With the country in chaos and reeling from the shooting of Dollfuss, Prince Stahremberg today officially proclaimed a State of Emergency across the nation, from the steps of the Schonbrunn palace, where he and the cabinet have been working tirelessly to form some response to the crisis since the shooting. Calling on all Austrians to respect the newly imposed curfews, roadblocks, and searches, and to "resist any subversion by the enemies of our nation".\n\nHowever, some are worrying that his words have already fallen on deaf ears. Across Austria, the ugly beast of socialism has reared its head once more. In every town what's left of the SDAPO and KPO paramilitaries are rioting, and all too many supporters of these groups are turning out to show their support.\n\nVienna itself seems to be at the centre of this, with massive socialist demonstrations springing up. The threat to our grip on power is obvious. We must move to secure our position, and we must do it now."
aut.15.a:0 "I want these red scum locked up by the morning!"
aut.16.t:0 "Chaos in Vienna"
aut.16.d:0 "We have failed. Without any sufficient show of strength against the socialists, Vienna is on the verge of revolution. Amidst constant rioting and attacks on the Heimwehr, the police, the army, and any other presumed opponents of their revolution, order has evaporated in the city.\n\nIt seems that the only thing we can do to hold onto power is to disperse the rebels by any means necessary. Loyal Generals and Heimwehr commanders have planned an operation to crush this revolution in one fell swoop, but the unspoken truth is that their proposal is a massacre. What loyal forces remain in Vienna will be urgently reinforced, and will be ordered to fire at will upon the poorly armed and untrained crowds. This alone, it appears, can save the Standestaat."
aut.16.a:0 "We have no choice. Fire at will."
aut.16.b:0 "This is madness, we can't slaaughter our own people!"
aut.17.t:0 "Vienna Secured"
aut.17.d:0 "This morning, as the socialists and their allies arrived in the streets for another day of havoc, they were greeted by an astonishing sight. In every street and every square, hundreds of soldiers and Heimwehr, fully equipped with guns pointed right ahead, stared them down. Their revolution was well and truly over.\n\Although a few madmen attempted to fight on - inevitably commiting suicide in the process - the crowds were mostly dispersed calmly, with little bloodshed. Most simply returned to their homes, intimidated but unharmed. The worse elements, those armed or otherwise violent, have been rounded up and will be properly dealt with.\n\Although the country is still shaken and far from stable, a sembalnce of order has returned - and for that we should be grateful."
aut.17.a:0 "Thank God for that!"]
aut.18.t:0 "The Vienna Massacre"
aut.18.d:0 "Our plan has been executed, and the nation is reeling in shock and trauma. This morning, as the protesters and paramilitaries turned out for another day of rebellion, they were fired upon indiscriminately by uncoordinated groups of Heimwehr and soldiers.\n\Realising that time was running out, a large group of Schutzbunders attempted to storm the Chancellery in an abortive putsch. Although Stahremberg considered fleeing, the attempt to sieze power as rapidly undone, and his would-be assassins were quickly mowed down by hastily assembled machine guns in the streets below.\n\With hundreds wounded or dead, and buildings across the city in ruins, the nation is deeply shaken. No longer can the VF claim the calm, moderate reputation that Dollfuss carefully built, and Stahremberg's own reputation as a murderer will be hard to live down, likely strengthening the hand of Kurt Schussnigg, should he seek power. One thing is sure, however: that Austria will never fall to the Revolution."
aut.18.a:0 "Good God..."
aut.19.t:0 "The Revolution"
aut.19.d:0 "Early this morning, Austria's fate was changed forever. With only small and diorganised bands of Heimwehr putting up resistance, socialist militiamne, dominated by the Schutzbunders of the SDAPO, stormed Vienna. Cheered on by the crowds in the street and met with little resistance, they secured administrative and media buildings across the city one by one. The chancellery fell at 1:34 AM, with three loyalist Heimwehr men falling during its capture. It was later confirmed that Ernst Rudiger Stahremberg has fled with much of his cabinet across the border to Hungary, while Kurt Schussnigg is rumoured to have arrived in Berne, having allegedly travelled by train under disguise.\n\Leftist militias have by now siezed control across the country, engaging in sporadic clashes with the Heimwehr and hurridly forming new administrations. In Viennna, the veteran Social Democrat and father of the Austrian republic, Karl Renner, has accepted the invitation to form a new provisional government to guide Austria away from Dollfuss’s legacy./n/It is inevitbale that this won't be the end of Austria's troubles, of course. Both liberal democrats and communists support the new regime, but it can of course seek to fulfill only one of their visions. Meanwhile, large numbers of Heimwehr are preparing to resist us to the last, and it is certain that Stahremberg will seek to assemble a government in exile.\n\nNobody knows what the future has in store, but for now, at least, everybody is hopeful."

The people are finally moving on from the tragic events and instability, and the new administration is now generally accepted. What momentum the SDAPO gained has evaporated, and they will likely never recover from the crackdowns.\n\nAlthough we have much work left to do, we can finally breathe a sigh of relief. We're safe."
aut.21.a:0 "Perfect!"
aut.22.t:0 "Schussnigg's Speech"
aut.22.d:0 "The inevitable has happened, and Kurt Schussnigg has, in all but name, launched his bid for leadership of the VF.\n\n\Speaking in Salzburg, he told the gathered crowd, drawn largely from the more moderate wing of the VF, that reform was the only answer to Austria's problems. Without the brilliant leadership of Dollfuss, he stated, only a new technocratic, proffessional approach could solve the crisis. Denouncing "strongmen and demagogues", an unsubtle attack on Stahremberg, he declared that only through "the prevalence of calm voices and clear heads" could the nation be saved./n/nAlthough Stahremberg's instinct is to remove him from his office and arrest him, Schussnigg controls the police through his role of Interior Minister, and has a great deal of influence across the Party and country, making such a course of action impossible. What's more we can only have a hope of restoring order to the country if the police and Schussnigg's other allies remain loyal - if not to Stahremberg himself, then simply to the Austrian State as it stands and to the principle of unity.\n\nAs such, our only option is to play the long game, and wait for Schussnigg's efforts to fizzle out, while subtly undermining him. Although the struggle for power may take some work, we must win it: for God, for Austria, for us all."
aut.22.a:0 "We'll deal with the bastard, just you see!"
aut.23.t:0 "Meeting the Church?"
aut.23.d:0 "Although it still seems unlikely that Schussnigg will be able to seriously challenge us, his efforts are gradually gathering pace, and it appears that he plans to secure the loyalty of various interest groups within Austria, as a way of undermining our authority and forcing us out. One such group is the Church: if we can reaffirm their implicit support for Stahremberg, we could prove our own legitimacy around the country, but alienating them could well drive them into the arms of Schussnigg. As such, many of Stahremberg's allies are calling on us to arrange a meeting with Cardinal Innitzer, to ensure the Church's loyalty."
aut.23.a:0 "Very well"
aut.23.b:0 "It's not worth it"
aut.24.t:0 "A Meeting with Innitzer"
aut.24.d:0 "Our planned meeting with Cardinal Innitzer has now taken place, and the Cardinal has siezed the opportunity to request greater concessions to the Church in Austria, and new efforts on our part to promote Catholic values and teachings. Accepting his demands would ensure the favour and tacit backing of the Church, while turning Innitzer down could well lead Schussnigg from gain his loyalty. However, some argue that the man's demands are simply too many, and that making such concessions could set a dangerous precedent and weaken our own hand. Which course of action do we take?"
aut.24.a:0 "We need to accept"
aut.24.b:0 "Innitzer must be mad to think we'll serve his every whim like this!"
aut.25.t:0 "Schussnigg meets Innitzer"
aut.25.d:0 "Today, our informers have discovered a deeply unsettling truth: that Cardinal Innitzer, presumably feeling alienated by the Stahremberg cabinet and concerned that it would take insufficient care of the Church's status in Austria, has met Kurt Schussnigg. While we'll never really know what was agreed, we can surely expect Schussnigg to greatly use this to legitimise himself among Austrian Catholics, and gain greater support. We have lost the Church's goodwill, and once Schussnigg has been dealt with it will surely take some effort to rebuild our relationship."
aut.25.a:0 "Damn!"
aut.26.t:0 "Schussnigg's Friends"
aut.26.d:0 "From the start of the power struggle, we have been forced to recognise that Schussnigg's influence is simply too great for us to directly dismiss or arrest him. However, if we move with sufficient speed and subtlety, we may be able to strike a major blow at Schussnigg's influence. By rapidly demoting, dismissing, or in extreme cases outright arresting his many supporters within the beureaucracy, we may be able to prevent him from strengthening his existing ties with prominent beureaucrats, and intimidate many others out of supporting him. Others, however, are saying that this simply isn't worth the effort, and an administrative purge would cause a great deal of chaos which would only further hinder our government."
aut.26.a:0 "We have to do it"
aut.26.b:0 "We aren't tyrants"
aut.27.t:0 "Schussnigg Consolidates Alliances"
aut.27.d:0 "Alaring newss has reached us: that Kurt Schussnigg has recently been further meeting with prominent administrators and beuraeaucrats, who are attracted by his technocratic approach and rehtoric. It appears that he has secured his alliance with these figures for good, and any attempt to purge them from here on will be off-limits, as they are now under his umbrella. We can assume from here on that much of the beureaucracy will support Schussnigg, and do what ir can to aid him."
aut.27.a:0 "Scheisse!"
aut.28.t:0 "Schussnigg Appeals to the People"
aut.28.d:0 "Schussnigg has now intensified his efforts to gain popular support, making an effort  to appear publicly at every opportunity, and frequently giving speeches outlining his own moderate, technocratic vision for Austria, and subtly attacking Stahremberg as an incomptetent and overprivileged strongman. Many within the Cabinet are urging us to do something about this threat to authority, censoring the publicity that Schussnigg recieves and depriving him of opportunities to speak. They claim that this could pre-empt much of the damage he's doing, but others are arguing that it simply isn;t worth the effort, and could make us appear overly tyrranical and insecure about our position."
aut.28.a:0 "It's the only way"
aut.28.b:0 "This is too far"
aut.29.t:0 "Meeting the General Staff"
aut.29.d:0 "Although meetings with the military's general staff are a fairly routine thing - especially in a time of crisis - today's proved to be very different. Seemingly siezing on our position of weakness and need for allies in the power struggle, General Jansa, the Chief of Staff, has presented us with a set of demands to increase our funding for the military, increase the Army's autonomy from the civillian government, and, notably, that Stahremberg assure him that the Heimwehr will never challenge or replace the Army's status of the defenders of the nation.\n\nMost in the regime believe we have no choice but to accept, lest we alienate the army and drive it into Schussnigg's hands. Others, however, believe we need to teach Jansa that Stahremberg, not himself, is the leader of Austria, and that he has no right to demand such concessions."
aut.29.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
aut.29.b:0 "Who does Jansa think he is?"
aut.30.t:0 "Schussnigg Meets Jansa"
aut.30.d:0 "One of the most alarming reports yet has reached Stahremberg's desk: that yesterday, in what the two assumed would be total secrecy, Schussnigg and Jansa. It is clear that the general, alienated by our refusal to make concessions to him, and likely fearing that the Heimwehr will outstrip the Army in its prestige and influence, has been driven into Schussnigg's arms. With the support of the Army, Schussnigg will be all but impossible to bring down, and we can only hope that he quietly fades into irrelevance."
aut.30.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
aut.31.t:0 "The Police Dominates the Country"
aut.31.d:0 "In our efforts to restore order, our choice to exclusively use the police has come back to bite us. As the police is controlled by Schussnigg through his role of Interior Minister, he has been able to greatly extend his influence across the country, behind the scenes of restoring stability. This has greatly strenghtened his position in the power struggle, and his influence in the government seems to be only increasing."
aut.31.a:0 "Blast!"
aut.32.t:0 "Schussnigg Loses Momentum"
aut.32.d:0 "At long last, we can breathe a sigh of relief. Having struggled to gain new backers or other sources of power, Kurt Schussnigg's efforts to assume leadership of the VF and the country have ran out of momentum, and are rapidly fading into irrelevance. It is clear that Stahremberg has triumphed in the power struggle, as we always knew he would.\n\nAs such, there is now no reason not to finally press through with the revision to the constitution, merging the posts of both Bundesprasident and Bundeskanzler under Prince Stahremberg himself. We could not have hoped for a better successor to Dr. Dollfuss, and this great man can finally assume the powers needed to lead our great homeland to glory, honouring Dollfuss's legacy and fulfilling his vision."
aut.32.a:0 "Hurrah!"
aut.33.t:0 "Stahremberg Resigns"
aut.33.d:0 "It is now clear that Kurt Schussnigg's efforts to take over the VF and the nation have only intensified, and only gathered strength. Prince Starhemberg can no longer hide from this harsh reality, and today offered his resignation to President Miklas, astonishing the nation. In his place, Miklas has already appointed Schussnigg.\n\nWith nothing now standing in his way, Schussnigg can now go ahead with Dollfuss’s earlier revision to the constitution, and merge the posts of Bundeskanzler and Bundesprasident under himself, allowing him to fully pursue his vision for Austria. At long last, the nation is in determines, responsible hands, and for that we should rejoice."
aut.33.a:0 "Hurrah!"
aut.34.t:0 "The Rise of Figl"
aut.34.d:0 "The aftermath of the ascent of Schussnigg and his beuraeaucratic supportersw has seen one interesting development: the parralell rise through the ranks of Austria's beuraeaucracy of the young Leopold Figl. An agrarian at heart, he was one of Dollfuss’s proteges since before the Standestaat was born, and has served for some years on the Federal Economic Council. A staunch supporter of Schussnigg, our rise to power has benefited him enormously, and his career seems destined for new heights.\n\nHowever, the strongly reformist insticnts that motivated him to back Schussnigg may pose a threat to us in the long run. It is clear that Figl still harbours some sympathy for the democratic system, and sees Schussnigg's more limited reforms as an opportunity to pursue his own much more democratic agenda. He has clearly gathered around him a clique of like-minded young reformists within the beureaucy, which is being dubbed the "young guard".\n\nAlthough Figl and his allies still lack the political capital to make any major moves, we need to decide on our stance towards them."
aut.34.a:0 "Support their efforts - Figl could be a valuable ally"
aut.34.b:0 "Stay ambivalent for now"
aut.34.c:0 "Their reformism goes too far - we should suppress them while there's still time"
aut.35.t:0 "The Young Guard Wants Concessions"
aut.35.d:0 "Having been hitherto supported by Schussnigg, Figl and his clique have been able to greatly increase their influence and support. Now, they are subtly making clear to us, through an occasional word here and the tacit implications of a speech there, that they are becoming dissatisfied with the pace and reach of our reforms. It is clear that, without further democratisation of the Standestaat, it will be impossible to placate Figl and his allies. This would mean sacrifcing a great many of Schussnigg's own ideals of a more authoritarian technocracy, and indeed could be seen as a betrayal of what Dollfuss strove to build. Many, however, believe that it is both the right course of action for us, aby tis point the only course of action we can practically take."
aut.35.a:0 "Very well, Figl can have his reforms"
aut.35.b:0 "This is too far"
aut.36.t:0 "Concerns Among the Conservatives"
aut.36.d:0 "Our recent concessions to the Young Guard have gone some way to alarm the more hardline and conservative elements of Schussnigg's government. In a meeting today with the hardliner Emil Fey, an arch-conservative who found his way into Schussnigg's circle more out of his hatred for Starhemberg than anything else, Schussnigg was warned that Figl is a major threat to the integirty of the Standestaat. Fey proceeded to state that proceeding with his reforms will only serve to embitter large swathes of the population, and appear to be a shameless betrayal of the legacy of Dollfuss. While we knew such a reaction was coming when we agreed to Figl, we must now decide what to do."
aut.36.a:0 "Fey is right: we should put the Young Guard in its place"
aut.36.b:0 "One bitter reactionary doesn't matter"
aut.37.t:0 "A Meeting with Figl"
aut.37.d:0 "It appears that not even the massive concessions we agreed to make to Figl are the full extent of what he wants from us: or indeed, what he will take from us. Today, Figl met with Schussnigg, and, far beyond what Schussnigg expected to be a simple conclusion of what has already been agreed, proceeded to demand a far more extensive democratisation of Austria - and, in practice, a new consolidation of the Young Guard's power, with conservatives like Fey quietly sidelined. It would appear that we no longer have the power to turn Figl down: our continuous backing up to now has allowed his allies to gain the support of swathes of the Army and beureaucracy, and his influence is simply too extensive for us to move againt him. All we can do now is agree, and resign ourselves to becoming puppets of these scheming liberalisers."
aut.37.a:0 "So be it..."
aut.38.t:0 "The Young Guard Frustrated"
aut.38.d:0 "Our failure to further reform the state to meet their demands has left Figl and the Young Guard deeply frustrated with us, pericieving us as incompetent dictators who will only perpetuate politcial inertia through our failure to adapt. Many now believe we should agree to further concessions for them, lest we alienate them too much and lose many competent administrators in the process. Others, however, argue that we should simply try to negotiate a compromise with them, in which they will maintain their positions and influence in exchange for giving up on their more liberal ideals."
aut.38.a:0 "Fine, let them have their reforms"
aut.38.b:0 "Find a compromise instead"
aut.39.t:0 "The Young Guard Grows in Influence"
aut.39.d:0 "It is becoming clear that, in recent weeks, Figl and the clique around him have managed to significantly increase their power within the administration, gaining much publicity in the process. In the process, they are greatly antagonising the more conservative members of the regime, notably Emil Fey, an old Heimwehr man who was propelled into Schussnigg's circle almost exclusively because of his contempt for Starhemberg.\n\nSo far, we have tried to ignore the growth of Figl's clique, but it is clear by now that we can do so no longer, and much reach a decision on what to do with them. Many believe that we should recognise their growing influence and draw closer to them, while the conservatives within the government are urging us to reign them in, one way or another."
aut.39.a:0 "We should encourage their efforts"
aut.39.b:0 "Let's reign them in before they get too confident"
aut.40.t:0 "Reigning in the Young Guard"
aut.40.d:0 "Although we have resolved to reign in the influence of Figl and his reformist clique, different approaches as to how we should do this are now being debated. Many believe we should simply start quietly demoting them, and further ignore their suggested reforms. Others, however, especially Emil Fey and his allies, are urging us to go a step further and purge them outright. Although many think this is a step too far and simply unnecessary, others believe that it will put a definite end to the question of how far our reforms will go."
aut.40.a:0 "Just ease them out of power"
aut.40.b:0 "Fey has a point - purge them"
aut.41.t:0 "The Young Guard Resists Demotions"
aut.41.d:0 "Our recent moves to demote the members of Figl's clique and move them away from influential positions has proved to be harder than expected, with many determinedly resisting their demotions, and some even outright refusing to pack up and leave their offices. Before the situation escalates further, or, even worse, becomes public, we need to work out our next move. Many think we should offer them an olive branch, allowing them to hold on to their jobs provided they toe the line and give up on further democratisation, while Fey is again arguing that they simply can't be trusted, and that we must purge them before it's too late."
aut.41.a:0 "We need to compromise"
aut.41.b:0 "Fey's been proven right: purge them"
aut.42.t:0 "Figl Goes on the Run"
aut.42.d:0 "Our efforts to purge the Young Guard have clearly met with much less success than we might have hoped, and have today ended in disaster. In a dramatic series of events, Leopold Figl fled the group of policemen who had been sent to detain him, causing a chase through Vienna: a chase which, we have been informed, our men lost. Figl's wherebaouts are now unknown, and it is likely he will be plotting against us and seeking to use what political capital he has left to bring us down.\n\nThere is only one way that we can hope to stop this, and that is by calling in any possible aid from Emil Fey and his clique of hardliners. Having served for some time as Dollfuss’s Vice Chancellor, and an old Heimwehr man, Fey will doubtless know a great deal about Figl's likely next move, and may be able to use his security resources and knowledge to help us track him down. It is, however, inevitable that such aid will come at a dear price, and we may well be expected to make a great nmany concessions in order to keep Fey happy. Nonetheless, we have no choice."
aut.42.a:0 "So be it: arrange a meeting with Fey"
aut.43.t:0 "A Meeting With Fey"
aut.43.d:0 "Today, Kurt Schussnigg sat down for a special meeting with Emil Fey, a man whose career truly has been ascendent in recent months. It was agreed between the two men that Fey would put all the resources and contacts at his disposal towards the capture of Figl and eradication of the traitors and criminals in the Young Guard, and in exchange that Fey would rise extensievly through the ranks of the VF, becoming Schussnigg's new Vice Chancellor and seeing many of his counter-reforms implemented.\n\nImplicit in this deal, however, is Schussnigg's admission of his own defeat: defeat by the liberals and young reformers, who exploited and betrayed his trust, and now, betrayal by the conservatives, who stand poised to reverse every single one of his hard-won reforms. He's lost."
aut.43.a:0 "Reform was always doomed to fail..."
aut.44.t:0 "Fey's Request"
aut.44.d:0 "Our efforts to sideline and suppress the reformist Young Guard have indirectly been a great boost for the influence of the conservatives within our government, notably the old Heimwehr man Emil Fey, a hardliner who gravitated towards Schussnigg almost exclusively because of his contempt for Starhemberg.\n\nNow, greatly fearing the remaining influence of the Young Guard, Fey has requested that we go significantly further in our suppression of them, and begin to purge them outright. Many now believe that this is the only way we can properly escape from their influence and never-ending demands for democratisation, but there are nonetheless a great many others who see such a move as needlessly tyrranical, arguing that we should instead move more subtly to begin dismissing and demoting them."
aut.44.a:0 "Fey's right, what's the harm?"
aut.44.b:0 "We can do this more quietly"
aut.46.t:0 "Compromise with the Young Guard"
aut.46.d:0 "Today, our efforts to reach a mutually favourable settlement with Figl and his fellow reformists have paid off. They have agreed to renounce their more overtly democratic rhetoric and requests, and in exchange will be allowed to continue their careers unimpeded. The deal, sealed today in a private meeting between Schussnigg and Figl, will ensure both the availability of countless talented administrators and the survival of Schussnigg's vision. We couldn't have hoped for a better outcome."
aut.46.a:0 "Thank God for that!"
