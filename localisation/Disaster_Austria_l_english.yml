### Decisions ###

### Focuses ###

AUT_merge_the_posts:0 "Merge the Posts"
AUT_merge_the_posts_desc:0 "To fully solidify Dollfuss’s hold on power, it is now being proposed that we merge Miklas's post of Bundesprasident, the oficial head of state with his own post of Bundeskanzler. This would clearly make him the sole, unchallenged power in Austria, but we will need to tread carefully to succeed."
AUT_economic_reforms:0 "Economic Reforms"
AUT_economic_reforms_desc:0 "Despite all of our previous efforts at turning around the Austrian economy, it remains stagnant at best. In the long term this could greatly undermine the credibility of our government and policies, so we must act quickly to reinvigorate the economy."
AUT_maintain_agrarianism:0 "Maintain Agrarianism"
AUT_maintain_agrarianism_desc:0 "A man of peasant roots himself, Dollfuss has, since the start of his career, been an agrarian through and through. He has always championed the interests of the Austrian peasantry, for in them alone can be seen the true spirit of the Catholic German people. Although we need to re-energise our policies, the principles behind them need not change."
AUT_new_industrialism:0 "New Industrialism"
AUT_new_industrialism_desc:0 "Although we have always been an agrarian party, the party of the common farmer, we can no longer pretend to ourselves that these policies simply are not working. If Austria’s economy is stagnant, it is because she is completely bereft of the industry with which to compete with other nations. Only a new industrialisation drive will solve the problems we are faced with."
AUT_corporatist_ideals:0 "Corporatist Ideals"
AUT_corporatist_ideals_desc:0 "Inspired by the Quadregismo Anno and by our opposition to both socialism and liberal capitalism, corporatist ideology has always guided our economic policy. We should now look to strenghten the Corporate State in Austria, and further legally enshrine our ideals."
AUT_further_state_intervention:0 "Further State Intervention"
AUT_further_state_intervention_desc:0 "The failings of liberal nations to deal with the effects of the Depression, and indeed of previous Austrian governments to do so, make clear that only determined and precise state intervention can turn an economy around. Through increasing our spending and our investments, we should pull Austria out of the crisis in no time!"
AUT_protect_the_common_farmer:0 "Protect the Common Farmer"
AUT_protect_the_common_farmer_desc:0 "How can the honest, hardworking small farmers of this nation hope to survive in a global market, faced with unlimited competition from vast foreign businesses? If we are truly to represent the farmers of Austria, we must enact new tarriffs to ensure a market for their hard-earned produce."
AUT_grain_exports:0 "Grain Exports"
AUT_grain_exports_desc:0 "Having now strenghtened the hand of our own agriculutral sector and greatly increased our own production through the tarriffs, we can now look to exporting much larger amounts of our newly plentiful grain. It's no secret that in many a nation agriculuture has not recovered as it has here, and the abundance of buyers and potential trade deals will surely go some way to reinvigorating the economy."
AUT_aristocratic_ties:0 "Aristocratic Ties"
AUT_aristocratic_ties_desc:0 "As well as the peasantry, we have another key support base in Austria’s ancient aristocracy. Represented in our government by such figures as Prince Stahremberg, they have a great deal of influence and we would be failing ourselves if we couldn't keep them happy with our policies. As such we should meet with and reach out to key aristocrats, and seek to accomodate their demands."
AUT_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
AUT_land_reform_desc:0 "Having now secured the loyalty of the gentry, we should in return expect them to collaborate with us in finally implementing our long promised land reform projects, distributing significant amounts of land to both the State and smaller farmers. Witht the co-operation of all, Austrian agriculture will flourish like never before!"
AUT_nation_of_farmers:0 "A Nation of Farmers"
AUT_nation_of_farmers_desc:0 "With our agrarian reforms firmly in place and the loyalty of the rural population, rich and poor alike, secured, we can truly call oursleves a nation of farmers. Agriculutree is what has lifted our economy out of stagnation, and agriculture is what shall ensure future growth. And within the honourable peasantry of this nation, the true spirit of the Catholic German is seen."
AUT_farmers_to_factorymen:0 "Farmers to Factorymen"
AUT_farmers_to_factorymen_desc:0 "As we imdustrialise we will need men to work in the new factories and we can only hope to do this by promoting migration from the countryside to expanind rural areas. As agriculture loses its sway on the economy, farmers will be forced to move to the cities anyway, so we might as well encourage them to do so now."
AUT_new_export_markets:0 "New Export Markets"
AUT_new_export_markets_desc:0 "With our industrial capacity rapidly increasing, Austrian businesses are now branching out into a number of new goods, and should soon be able to compete with foreign companies. Subsidising these efforts and negotiating trade deals on their bhealf should reinvigorate our economy, and help pull us out of the erstwhile slump."
AUT_ties_with_business:0 "Ties With Business"
AUT_ties_with_business_desc:0 "As we indutrialise we will need the support of the businessmen of this country, on whom we must depend to lead the economy forwards. By meeting with prominent business representatives and giving them more sway in the government, we can ssure that their needs are accomodated and their loyalty is secured."
AUT_new_labour_charter:0 "New Labour Charter"
AUT_new_labour_charter_desc:0 "Having now secured the allegiance of business, we should expect them to fulfill their end of the bargain, integrating their companies into the larger state corporations and agreeing to a new Charter on Workers' Rights, to be signed in accordance with the leaders of our state-controlled Trade Unions. The principle of corporatism in Austria will be strenghtened like never before."
AUT_nation_of_industry:0 "A Nation of Industry"
AUT_nation_of_industry_desc:0 "With our industrial reforms now in place, and new factories sprining up around the country, we can finally proclaim that Austria is now a truly industrial nation. Our vastly enhanced production, within the asupices of the Corporate State, will lead to previously impossible levels of prosperity for all Austrians."
AUT_austrian_miracle:0 "The Austrian Miracle"
AUT_austrian_miracle_desc:0 "We have done it. With our economic reforms firmly implemented and the country pulled clean out of the depression, an economic boom has set in. As foreign investemnt soars and the standard of living skyrockets, the press proclaims this the "Austrian Miracle". And what else is it, for it is our faith in God and dedication to Him that has brought us this far."
AUT_deepen_church_ties:0 "Deepen Church Ties"
AUT_deepen_church_ties_desc:0 "Now that we have further consolidated power, we should look to further strenghtening our bonds with the only guarantor of a righteous and just government, and of a moral population - the Catholic Church. Through further meeting with the clergy, especially Cardinal Innitzer, and strenghtening the role of Catholic teachings in our law, we can solidify the Church's position in Austria and further gain their approval."
AUT_revise_the_concordat:0 "Revise the Concordat"
AUT_revise_the_concordat_desc:0 "Having signed a Concordat with the Papacy in 1934, it may now be time to review the agreemeent. If we can secure increased Church backing for education and social programs in Austria, our own position will be greatly strenghtened and the people will be benefited enormously. Meanwhile, the tacit support of the Catholic Church will further legitimise our regime."
AUT_clergy_in_the_government:0 "Clergy in the Government"
AUT_clergy_in_the_government_desc:0 "Having resolved to draw closer to the Church, we would now be well advised to reach out to the Priests of Austria, involving them more in local government, and consulting prominent clergymen on legislation. With the advice and support of men of God, Austria will be greater than ever."
AUT_promote_catholic_social_teaching:0 "Promote Catholic Social Teaching"
AUT_promote_catholic_social_teaching_desc:0 "If we are to   truly repay the trust and support of the Church, we must seek to make Austrian society truly reflect its teaching. Throughreforms to education, new family progrmas, and public information campaigns, we can begin to spread the Church's social teaching around the nation."
AUT_unite_the_youth_movements:0 "Unite the Youth Movements"
AUT_unite_the_youth_movements_desc:0 "There are already several Catholic and nationalist youth groups in Austria, such as the Heimwehr's Young Fatherland, the Ostmarkjugend, and the Christian-German Gymnastics Youth. Although these are already tied to our regime, Guido Zernatto now intends to unite them into one group, the Osterreichisches Jungvolk. This new movement will teach the youth true Catholic values, and prepare them to defend Austria."
AUT_extol_dollfuss_faith:0 "Extol Dollfuss’s Faith"
AUT_extol_dollfuss_faith_desc:0 "Before first accepting the post of Chancellor, Dollfuss prayed all night in his favourite church. His piety has long been well known, and has always earned him the respect of the public and of the Church. It is now time to take advantage of this, encouraging the populace to follow his admirable example and emulate his devotion to God."
AUT_catholic_education:0 "Catholic Education"
AUT_catholic_education_desc:0 "Having agreed on education provisions in the revised Concordat, we should now expand on this further, greatly increasing our overall funding for education while also bringing the teachings of the Church further into the curriculum. With a faithful and educated youth, Austria will truly prosper!"
AUT_a_moral_people:0 "A Moral People"
AUT_a_moral_people_desc:0 "With our pro_Catholic policies having now been in place for some time, Austrian society is changing to reflect our ideals, with a greater emphasis on Christianity and morality developing among much of the population, and the Catholic aspects of Austria’s culture becoming more prominent. We should use this to our advantage, and encourage the people to go even further for s moral Austria."
AUT_austrian_identity:0 "The Austrian Identity"
AUT_austrian_identity_desc:0 "It is absolutely vital for the survival of Austria and of our faith that we stamp out what remains of pan-Germanism, greeatly emphasising sll that sets us apart from our neighbours to the North. By evoking a new pride in AUstria's own, unique culture and history we can give rise to a new patriotism, and strenghte our own government."
AUT_catholic_nationalism:0 "Catjolic Nationalism"
AUT_catholic_nationalism_desc:0 "Now that we have worked towards evoking a new national pride among the people, it is important that we place great emphasis on the Catholic elements of Austrian patriotism. To defend Austria is to defend its faith and its God: let none forget this truth."
AUT_lead_by_example:0 "Lead By Example"
AUT_lead_by_example_desc:0 "Now, more than ever, it is crucial that Dollfuss proves himself to be the most righteous leader Austria could hope for. Through further showing his own credentials as a devout Catholic and a brave patriot with a distinguished record in the great war, Dollfuss can aptly remind the people that to commit to Austria is to commit to his government."
AUT_a_moral_government:0 "A Moral Government"
AUT_a_moral_government_desc:0 "Having gone so far to promote patriotism and morality among the public, we should esnure that we ourselves aren't falling short of the standards we've set. Through routing out the inevitable corruption, treason, and decadence within the statem we can ttrly prove ourselves to the people as a fair and principled government."
AUT_mit_dollfuss_in_die_neue_zeit:0 "Mit Dollfuss in die Neue Zeit"
AUT_mit_dollfuss_in_die_neue_zeit_desc:0 "A new age is dawning over Austria. As the Church bells peel and the Heimwehr marches through the street, as the drums of the OJV beat and  the anthem sounds far and wide, it is clear to all thst Dollfuss has won. Austtria has been rebuilt in his vision and to his specifications, and nothing is left to stop him. All as it should be."

AUT_socialist_discotent:0 "Socialist Resistance"
AUT_socialist_discotent_desc:0 "Ever since the brief civil war in 1934, the Austrian socialist movement, dedpite being heavily oppressed and, formally, banned, has, under the leadership of Karl Renner, been a massive source of instability for our regime. If we can't nip these Red filth in the bud, there may be consequences for our government."
AUT_pan_germanist_discotent:0 "Pan-Germanist Resistance"
AUT_pan_germanist_discotent_desc:0 "Dollfuss’s anti-Pan German, Catholic, and Austrian Nationalist policies have alienated a large proportion of the population, who have always desired an Anschluss, or Union, with our fellow German-speakers to the North and West. These people are increasingly represented by Arthur Seyss-Inquart and his Grossdeutsche Nationale Partei, who believe that they alone can bring order and unity to all Germans."

### Events ###
aut.1.t:0 "The Situation of Austria in 1936"
aut.1.d:0 "Following a war strewn by hardships and military humiliation, the ancient Hapsburg Empire finally disintegrated in the Autumn of 1918. Initially, the Austrian public overwhelmingly hoped to overcome this monumental defeat through an Anschluss, or unification, with the young German republic. However, the victorious allies staunchly blocked all efforts to make the Pan-German dream a reality, and the later disintegration of Germany in 1919 made these hopes even more far-fetched. However, the young Austrian nation did have some luck, as the Italian civil war and chaos in the Balkans allowed Austrian troops to retake inland Carinthia and parts of Sudtirol. Nonetheless, Austria’s history through the 1920s was one of crippling diplomatic isolation, instability, and political violence, with an endless carousel of Conservative and Socialist governments unable to turn the country around.\n\nThis ended, however, in 1932, when the young economist Engelbert Dollfuss was appointed as Chancellor by President Miklas. Dollfuss wasted no time in implementing his Catholic and nationalist agenda. He hastily took advantage of a constitutional crisis to dissolve the Austrian parliament and crush the main part of the opposition to his government, before introducing a new authoritarian and corporatist constitution. Later surviving a socialist assassination attempt and crushing a leftist putsch by shelling large areas of workers’ housing, Dollfuss has proven that he is determined to stay in power to remodel Austria in his vision.\n\nAll is not well for Austria’s government, however. As socialist and extremist Pan-German nationalist underground movements continue to resist the regime, and with Dollfuss’s corporatist policies so far struggling to turn Austria’s economy around, time will only tell what Austria’s future will be."
aut.1.a:0 "Heil Osterreich!"
aut.2.t:0 "Modifying the Constitution"
aut.2.d:0 "Today President Miklas and Chancellor Dollfuss have officially gained the cabinet's approval for the Constitutional amendment that will merge their two roles. The new post of Bundeskanzler will double as Head of Government and Head of State, and will of course be filled by Dollfuss himself. Dollfuss’s path to total domination now seems clear."
aut.2.a:0 "Excellent"
aut.3.t:0 "The Flag Question"
aut.3.d:0 "With our preparations to revise the Austrian constitution well underway, a new proposal has arisen from some members of the cabinet. They suggest that the parrty flag of the Vaterlandische Front be elevated to the status of the national flag of Austria, replacing the current eagle flag. While many sympthise with this idea, believing it would do well to symbolise Dollfuss’s new consolidation of power, many others believe that we should maintain coontinuity, keeping the flag above party politics."
aut.3.a:0 "This is too far"
aut.3.b:0 "It's an effective gesture"
aut.4.t:0 "An Alarming Report"
aut.4.d:0 "Today a most alarming report arrived on Dr. Dollfuss’s desk, from our intelligence agenices monitoring the socialist underground. It states that the rally planned to celebrate the Constitutional Amendment may be in great danger from socialist terrorists, and the life of Dollfuss himself may be at risk. What's more, it states, security provisions are deeply inadequate, making mattersd even worse. As such sme in the cabinet are now calling for the rally to be called off entirely."
aut.4.a:0 "It can't be that bad: go ahead"
aut.4.b:0 "This is too risky: postpone the rally"
aut.5.t:0 "Security Provisions"
aut.5.d:0 "Having chosen to go ahead with the rally, we must now deal with the matter of security. Many in the police and military command are urging us to take extra precatuions in ligh of the recent report, deploying additional troops in Vienna and increasing our expenses to ensure Dollfuss’s safety. Others, however, believe we are being too anxious, and should take a calmer approach."
aut.5.a:0 "It's necessary"
aut.5.b:0 "This isn't worth it"
aut.6.t:0 "Reports of Demoralisation"
aut.6.d:0 "Our recent decisiont to cancel the scheduled rally to mark the revised constitution has clearly had a negtiave effect on the morale of our troops and of the Heimwehr paramilitaries. Many commanders are reporting their men questioning the dedication of the government, or whether the country truly is as stable as we claim. Why, they are aasking, is Dollfuss really feeling the need to hide from his own adoring people? Many are now suggesting that we go ahead with the rally to reverse these worries, but the political U-Turn could be embarrassing. Meanwhile, some are proposing that we make up for the cancellation through having Dollfuss give a major speech over the radio."
aut.6.a:0 "We need to swallow our pride and address the people"
aut.6.b:0 "Dollfuss should address the nation by radio instead"
aut.6.c:0 "It's simply too dangerous"
aut.7.t:0 "Rally in Vienna"
aut.7.d:0 "Our perseverance in the rally question has today paid off, with Dr Dollfuss addressing a giant rally near the Schonbrunn Palace shortly after the change to the constitution was formally ratified. In his speech he promised to use his powers to guide Austria further to economic strength and to shore up its postion in central Europe, as well as to do what he could to bring the nation closer to God."
aut.7.a:0 "Heil Dollfuss! Heil Osterreich!"
aut.8.t:0 "Dollfuss Addresses the Nation by Radio"
aut.8.d:0 "Today, having earlier called off a planned rally due to secuirty concerns, Dr Dollfuss spoke to the people of Austria via radio, having just ratified the amendment to the constitution. After apologising for failing to speak to them in person, and hoping that they would understand his reasoning in light of recent troubles with the radicals, he promised to use his powers to guide Austria further to economic strength and to shore up its postion in central Europe, as well as to do what he could to bring the nation closer to God."
aut.8.a:0 "Heil Dollfuss! Heil Osterreich!"
aut.9.t:0 "The Constitution is Amended"
aut.9.d:0 "Today, in a private ceremony in the Schonbrunn Palace, the Constitution of the Austrian Federal State was formally revised to merge the posts of Bundesprasident and Bundeskanzler under Engerlbert Dollfuss, essentially completing his consolidation of power. However, the fact that a planned rally to mark the event was cancelled, and that nothing was done to substitute for this, has fuelled much suspicion among the public, and much undermined our efforts to present ourselves as a confident, stable force in the country. While in time we shall surely recover, Dollfuss’s hand has for now been notably weakened."
aut.9.a:0 "Heil Dollfuss...?"
aut.10.t:0 "Dollfuss Shot!"
aut.10.d:0 "Having just ratified the constitution to merge the roles of Bundesprasident and Bundeskanzler under himself, Dollfuss proceeded to address a large rally near the Schonbrunn palace. However, shortly after he started speaking, a heavily armed group of men, presumably socialist militants, burst from the crows and fired indiscriminately at the platform. Dollfuss was hit three times, and passed away 2 hours later, having recieved the last rites.\n\nWith the constitutional amendment rendered, for now at least, obsolete, Miklas has appointed Ernst Rudiger Stahremberg as provisional Chancellor. Stahremberg, who was Dollfuss’s right hand man throughout his life, clearly sees himself as the natural successor, and with the support of his large Heimwehr paramilitary, and of much of the army, may well come to fill Dollfuss’s shoes.\n\nHowever, Dollfuss’s Minister for the Interior, Kurt Schussnigg, also believes himself capable of succeeding the great chancellor, and has the support of the more moderate wing of the VF, allegedly among them Miklas himself: not to mention that through his ministry he controls the police and he alone can now enforce the new state of emergency that Stahremberg has proclaimed./n/nOnly time will tell who shall rise to the top..."
aut.10.a:0 "May the Lord help us all..."
aut.11.t:0 "Changing the Concordat"
aut.11.d:0 "Today, the changes to the 1933 Concordat that, over the past weeks, had been carefully agreed with the Papacy through Cardinal Innitzer, were formally adopted. Signed in Rome by both Dollfuss and His Holiness, the new revised Concordat ensures Church funding and support for education and social programs in Austria, while also increasing the privileges of the Church snd its autonomy from the Austrian state and right to adjudicate on questions of Church teaching and doctrine.\n\This agreement will greatly strenghten our ties with the Church and our popularity among Austrian Catholics, and for that we are grateful.
aut.11.a:0 "Hallelujah!"
aut.12.t:0 "The Jewish Youth Groups"
aut.12.d:0 "Having merged the nationalist and Catholic youth movements into the OJV, we are now faced with an interesting problem: that of the Jewish youth groups, notably the Betar and Hakoah.\n\nMany  in our government, including some Jews sympathetic with Dollfuss, want to see these organisations also merged into the OJV, in order to further integrate Austrian Jews into mainstream society and to ensure that they too are taught the value of patriotism. Others, however, whether out of anti-semitism or conservative Judaism, would prefer to avoid this integration of Jews into the mainstream of society, while others simply see it as unfair to bring Jewish children into a Catholic youth group.
