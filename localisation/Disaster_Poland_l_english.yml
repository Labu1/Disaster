### Ideas ###
PLN_free_at_fast:0 "Free at Last"
PLN_free_at_fast_desc:0 "After 123 years Poland is free, yet the memory of heroes that gave their life for her is still fresh in people's memories. Inspired by their example, this time they won't go down without a fight."
PLN_minorities_and_borders:0 "Minorities and Borders"
PLN_minorities_and_borders_desc:0 "Even though the final shape of Poland is mostly an ethnicly national state, as Dmowski wanted, there are still many minorities that are at odds with the government. This problem is also tied with unstable situation at the eastern border."
PLN_leftist_organizations:0 "Leftist Organizations"
PLN_leftist_organizations_desc:0 "While most of the Polish nation is center-right and right wing, there are still substantial elements on the left side of the spectrum. With the long domination of Endecja in politics, various socialist organizations have risen to oppose them. Their methods range from peaceful to violent, the most radical ones used by Revolutinoary Faction."
PLN_catholic_support:0 "Catholic Support"
PLN_catholic_support_desc:0 "Catholic Church was always deeply tied with the nation, keeping the Polish traditions alive. In modern, independent times, the faithful and clergy are willing to support a government that respects their interests."

pln.1.t:0 "Rzeczpospolita in 1936"
pln.1.d:0 "Poland, a nation that suffered 123 years of foreign oppression, is once again free. With the end of the Great War, the three partitioners have fallen, yet it wasn't the end of Polish problems. While Dmowski's delegation fought at the failed Versailles Treaty to achieve the most beneficial terms, the newly born state was in chaos. Ukrainian armies, revolutinary militias, remnants of the German army, all were threatning the security of Second Polish Republic. The disaster was averted when Roman Dmowski and Haller's Blue Army returned from France. After the borders were relatively secured, it was time to create the first modern government of Poland. Dmowski's early efforts were disrupted by Józef Piłsudski, who tried to forcefully take over, but he was beaten back by Haller's Army. \nWith an alliance of right-wing parties dominated by National Democracy winning most of the elections, Poland enjoyed a stable but slow growth. This tranquility is now threatened by growing internal discontent and Dmowski's worsening health. If a dark day when he dies ever comes, the fate of Poland will become uncertain."
