### Ideas ###
PLN_free_at_fast:0 "Free at Last"
PLN_free_at_fast_desc:0 "After 123 years Poland is free, yet the memory of heroes that gave their life for her is still fresh in people's memories. Inspired by their example, this time they won't go down without a fight."
PLN_minorities_and_borders:0 "Minorities and Borders"
PLN_minorities_and_borders_desc:0 "Even though the final shape of Poland is mostly an ethnicly national state, as Dmowski wanted, there are still many minorities that are at odds with the government. This problem is also tied with unstable situation at the eastern border."
PLN_leftist_organizations:0 "Leftist Organizations"
PLN_leftist_organizations_desc:0 "While most of the Polish nation is center-right and right wing, there are still substantial elements on the left side of the spectrum. With the long domination of Endecja in politics, various socialist organizations have risen to oppose them. Their methods range from peaceful to violent, the most radical ones used by Revolutinoary Faction."
PLN_catholic_support:0 "Catholic Support"
PLN_catholic_support_desc:0 "Catholic Church was always deeply tied with the nation, keeping the Polish traditions alive. In modern, independent times, the faithful and clergy are willing to support a government that respects their interests."

pln.1.t:0 "Rzeczpospolita in 1936"
pln.1.d:0 "Poland, a nation that suffered 123 years of foreign oppression, is once again free. With the end of the Great War, all three powers that once partitioned the Polish nation have fallen. However, this hasn't been the end of Poland's problems. While Dmowski's delegation fought at the failed Versailles Treaty to achieve the best possible terms, the newly born state was fell into chaos. Ukrainian armies, revolutionary militias, remnants of the German army, all were threatening the security of Second Polish Republic. The disaster, however, was averted in the nick of time when Roman Dmowski , along with Jozef Haller's Blue Army, returned from France. Once the nation's frontiers had been reasonably consolidated, the nascent Polish government now had to organise a modern state. Dmowski's early efforts were disrupted by Józef Piłsudski, who attempted to forcefully take over, only to be beaten back by Haller's forces. \nWith an alliance of right-wing parties dominated by National Democracy frequently coming out on top in elections, Poland enjoyed a slow but steady growth. This tranquility is now threatened, however, by growing internal discontent and Dmowski's worsening health. When the inevitable dark day of his death comes, the fate of Poland will hang in the balance."
