Upon their newly gained fame,now they want to organize as an executive wing of the Collabration Government, acting as paramilitaries/policeman. Some local influental figures call them 'death squads', which  makes it really hard to enforce this new order on the native population, whom are already intolerant of our sublime state and our European, conservative values.

 ant.6.d:0 "Upon the latest clashes and secessions, the streets of South Kastamonu were silent. Some kids were playing outside, and parents were resupplying their weapons to protect them and their property. Will they be annexed by the Enverists, or get forced into a factory by the supposed 'humanists'. In this state of constant thinking and anxiety, the city residents heard a very loud noise, a noise of machinery and motors, like German Panzerwagens that patrolled the cities before Operation Exodus. The residents quickly hid and armed themselves and waited for the sounds to go away. They kept waiting, but the sounds became louder and closer. The residents of the city, which served as an armamanets and motorized works complex and a social zone for soldiers, finally looked upon their bunkers and saw tens of tanks, which were German-British hybrid light models, escorted by hundreds of soldiers, whom looked like British Young Units, a set of sharply dresse shocktroppers, but they were not young. They had facewrap that had symbols on them. Some had crosses, some had skulls and some had an interesting, circular figure. A megaphone cranked, and a masculine, charismatic voice uttered the words...n/ 'Drop your weapons. This territory is now under Skull Brigade control.'"
