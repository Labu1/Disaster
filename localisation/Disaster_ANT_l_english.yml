Upon their newly gained fame,now they want to organize as an executive wing of the Collabration Government, acting as paramilitaries/policeman. Some local influental figures call them 'death squads', which  makes it really hard to enforce this new order on the native population, whom are already intolerant of our sublime state and our European, conservative values. What should be done about this matter?"
