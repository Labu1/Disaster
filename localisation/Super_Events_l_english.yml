First of all, this soldier-born great nation has fought, built, helped, administred the land but was crushed by the owls of the infamous Byzantines which fed this nation to the Balkan monsters for centuries. Now, this nation stands with it's knowledge and experience that, it will no longer be a slave and no longer fight for other's intentions. There will be a new target for the nation that destroyed the world of these lies with the wind of steel, to work for the pledge of the nation, to die for the nation, and to kill for the nation!. \n- A Chant From the Kemalist Armed Forces of Ankara"
