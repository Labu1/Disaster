 ANT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In this world, even the victors lose. The Anatolian Sovereignty even in the eyes of Crown is just a failed experiment, where anarchy reins and mercenaries run free, while the locals watch in anger and disgust. While some shamelessly collaborate with the authorities, groups are organising to overthrow the shameless occupiers, like Ethem's revolutionaries. On the other hand people like J. F. C Fuller prepare for collapse, preparing by setting up large armies of white supremacists against the modernist view of the mercenaries. Will this abandoned protectorate finally see it's end or will it endure the brutal Anatolian slaughter?"
 CIB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While the Entente may have only aimed to punish the countries who stood in their way, there is one man who suffered the most. Ismail Enver Pasha. Being one of the three Young Turk Pashas, his ideas were the most radical. He envisioned a state, stretching from the Balkans to the eastern most part of Siberia, all inhabitated by Turks, and Turks only. But now he stands defeated, with little support and many seeing him as a traitor, his choices are limited, but his will remains the same... Will he redeem himself?"
 WRF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Just like it's allies, the Ottomans ended up dismembered and humiliated aswell. The ancient lands of Anatolia, once so mighty and brave now stands completely in ruins. Differing factions fight eachother for crazy ideals, like rabid dogs. Except one. Mustafa Kemal ''Ataturk'' stands proudly against the wave of these rabid dogs, preaching for a state of Turkish people, all equal, men and women. Basing his ideals mostly off of the French Republics, believing in secularism and modernity, Mustafa Kemal is ready to bring Turkey into a new age."

Getting dressed in a shiny black uniform  tailored by a German designer during the war, he headed out, wandering through the barracks to reach the command room. This former Ottoman prision in Van was still rusty, only recently being turned into a military building.  The Pasha sighed with bitternes, seeing how his once proud army was reduced to guaridng rotting buildings. While he was walking, he heard  noises coming from the command room. In anticipation of a hostile encounter, he grabbed his knife and a pistol, as the Caucasian tradition taught. Enver  blasted the door open to see Samet, his right hand man messing with maps and intel gathered from the Armenian bandits. Enver quickly grabbed him, shaking him for the explantion of his behaviour. The officers were not allowed to wake up until the Pasha did, much less enter the command room without his permision. \n 'I was crafting a plan, my Pasha!' said Samet, angrily staring at the Pasha. 'Then instead of walking in the command room like some illiterate Armenian thug, you'd better tell me if this 'plan' of yours is worth it!' Enver replied. Samet took his notebook and showed his war plans to the Pasha. \n 'You see my Pasha, the conquest of Eastern Turkish and Armenian territories have granted us strategic power in the mountains and Caucasus. Our state's greater ambition is to re-unify Anatolia into a strong Turkish nation, and doing so would require much more territory and resources. My plan is to strike south. at the  loose confederation of Kurdish tribes, named the Ashirats. Their central authority is non-existent, not to mention that their traditionalist outlook on militarism forces them to act like some lycee bully instead of a proper fighting force. We should seize their lands, use their men and women as slave workers, assimilate their children into our creed, exploit their agriculture and show them the real Turkish force.'\n Enver listened to his plan in admiration and geniunity. Even though he thought some terms that Samet used were radical, like forced slavery, he wasn't a very different man after all. 'You're pretty good. now go and wake up the shock troopers, raze those Zagros rats!' the pasha exclaimed with  the last shreds of joy that he still has in his older  years.\nSamet was gaining influence in the military academy, and now to be admired by the Pasha himself.

The doctors told him to relax but today was only a brief moment of  respite, there was still much to do. The issues of sectarian violence, new constitution, workers’ rights, female suffrage, new army laws and countless others couldn’t allow for Kemal to just rest.\n„Sir, is everything alright?” Ismet Inonu waited patiently for the Pasha to notice his entrance.\n„The fate of the nation is at stake. We may have won the war against Enver and other traitors, but there are still many issues plaguing Turkey. I can’t allow myself to sit and relax while the nation suffers, as those pathetic doctors  suggest. I am a statesman first, I would give my life for the nation if need be!” Mustafa Kemal exclaimed with a vigor not of an old and tired politician, but a young and charismatic leader.\n„Sir, I came here to take your orders on the matter of security in the eastern provinces.  Will the local police be enough or are we to send military forces to keep order? I am sure you would rather delegate this matter to your  subordinates, since dealing with the sickness must be ve-” right as the word sickness escaped Ismet’s mouth he heard a cane strike the floor.\n„Sickness, what sickness? Throughout this whole year I was active on the front lines, leading my men to glory, sharing their burdens. And now that the country is barely unified my council thinks I’m too ill to continue my work! I will n-”  the Pasha suddenly felt weak and was caught by Ismet before collapsing.\n„Kemal, listen to me. We all have seen those bloodied napkins, your sudden bouts of coughing, the empty cigar boxes and new diary entries. We do not wish for you to end like an old and powerless man, but you have to understand that if you continue like this there will be no one to lead Turkey!”\nThe Pasha was disappointed. Chiefly with himself for allowing his ailing state to show. But this only strengthened his resolve to go forth with the work his entire life was spent on. “Ismet, you are going east together with the soldiers,  aren’t you?

Suprised by the integrity and order in the city of Istanbul, an old and deranged Enver and a sick Kemal's meeting has been supervised and reported to be friendly with Enver's organizations and political membership being revoked and him getting sent away to Baku to live in a homestead with is own guard."
 tur.7.a:0 ""Farewell, old friend. I do not have much time left anyways.""

 tur.8.t:0 "The Catasthrope"
 tur.8.d:9 "It had been a tough few days for our leader. Following his sudden onset of of cirrhosis, Ataturk had gone to Istanbul for treatment, however, despite the doctors' best efforts, it was already too late.He still tried going on with his lifestyle as usual, heading to Council of Ministers meetings and taking care of his other political duties, as if nothing was wrong, but eventually his illness proved too much for him and today, our dear leader has sadly passed away.His death has sent our nation into shock and sorrow, with many people wondering why it had to come so soon. His funeral has been scheduled to happen a few weeks from now, and while the future of our country may look uncertain, what is certain to everyone is that Ataturk's legacy will be felt in Turkey for ages to come."
 tur.8.a:0 "This is the day of mourning. The Greatest Turk has passed away."

 tur.9.t:0 "Choosing The Succesor"
 tur.9.d:9 "After Kemal's death, debate stir in the National Council on who's going to succed him and 2 names are highlited. Ismet Inonu, diplomat and reformist or Fevzi Çakmak, an Orthodox kemalist with an iron fist and a great marshall. Who should we vote?"
 tur.9.a:0 "Ismet Inonu, a great statesman and a diplomatic genious."
 tur.9.b:0 "Fevzi Çakmak, the most renowned general of the army."

 tur.10.t:0 "An Iron Democracy?"
 tur.10.d:0 "After the death of Atatürk, Ismet, a reformer has came to power. The political groups in the country want to come to charge but even if Ismet is a reformist, he will safeguard his comrade's system of One Party. With the army and paramilitary's help, he will safeguard what he calls 'The Iron Democracy', a system where one party gives democratic systems to citizens. The opposition wants democratization and Ismet will not concede.. unless.."

 tur.15.t:0 "The Authoritarian Outrage"
 tur.15.d:0 "Despite his multiple reforms to bring Turkey closer towards Democracy, Ismet has decided in the end that he will maintain the current "Iron Democracy" system in Turkey, citing the fact that Turkey has only recently become a united country as one of his reasons, and explaining that it still needs a firm hand guiding it. Alongside that, he has also begun cracking down on other political parties within the nation, in order to maintain the current one party system and to make the country more united."
 tur.15.a:0 "Ave!"
 
 tur.12.t:0 "Democratic Kemalism?"
 tur.12.d:0 "Ataturk's wishes have finally been fulfilled. Under his reign, with iron willpower, he stabilized the country and brought reforms needed to bring Turkey into a new age. His successor Ismet Inonu has finally put an end to the so called ''Iron Democracy'' and is in the process of organizing the first ever elections. But to many surprise, the much beloved CHP is not gone. With the new elections being arranged, Inonu talked about the party taking up a form, which even the late Ataturk would agree to."

Even though his army is well trained, their monstrosities keep the native people of the land away from collabration."
 TIT_Turkish_Discontent_desc:0 "In response to Rosetta's monsterous attitude, politically aware Turks of the region formed many organizations to fight the Italian colonizers.Later on the organizations were merged into the Turkish Revolutionary Alliance. Now being organized, the alliance is a real threat to the Italian power over the colony."
 TIT_Forgotten_Colony_desc:0 "Italy, our beloved homeland has for all intents and purposes forgotten us. There was a time when the coasts of Anatolia were filled with Italian beauties here on a tourist trap disguised as a functioning colony, and our garrison was just a whole bunch of baby-faced recruits fresh out of boot camp hitting on those aforementioned beauties, but those times have long since passed. Due to the Italian civil war and economic downturn caused by the collapse of the united states, our once prosperous tourism industry collapsed. Since the colony couldn't run on bananas alone a new source of income was gravely needed. With our homeland in political turmoil and the colony bleeding cash, an "unusual" source of income was founded by the then newly appointed governor-general Mario Roatta. Ever since Roatta's appointment the colony has been turning a profit despite the lack of tourism, and while it is difficult to explain why there are so many ghost towns, and why Turkish guerilla fighters have increased exponentially under Roatta, as long as nothing major happens and the colony keeps turning a profit our homeland will continue to live in blissful ignorance"
 TIT_Legacy_Rhodes_desc:0 "Our army and officials need morale and inspiration to run this hellhole. We look back to our past, and to the Knights of Rhodes, the proud knights that safeguarded Christ's reign in Smyrna and Rhodes until the vicious, barbaric Turks came and pillaged them. Now 400 or so years after the turk despoiled the holy lands of Christendom, we have arrived. And it's due time for the turks to reap what they sowed all those years ago"

As he stood up and wore his infamous black outfit, a group of officers knocked on his door.\n "My Pasha, we have new reports. The Bursa Trials are concluded but Samet and his autonomous battalions are speculated to have ran east and also may be recruiting the Kemal-leaning soldiers from our army. On the other page, we have the situation of the country. Nationalists, Ottomanists and most youth supports our cause after we have shown how the Kemalists were weak Western assets to rule Anatolia from the shadows but some estates like the Liberals, Communists and Minorities are not really pleased with our triumph. The last breifing is about what the populace thinks of you, my pasha. Most citizens from the western parts are divided on the matter, some hailing you as a war hero and some believing you are the cause of this 'Disaster'. The East is purely on our side, and many Ethemite militarists are flocking from the Spartakist order to our Black Legions. We are leaving the case here and you, My Pasha, are the grandest authority to react to this issues."\n The officers all threw a salute and chanted "Emredin Paşam!". Enver smiled and put on his coat.\n "What I want to do further on is no more bloody conquest and brother wars but to unify the entire country under my rule. I have failed to hug Anatolia when I was the War Minister BUT I will not fail again. From Thrace to Hakkari, the chants of 'Türküm, Doğruyum, Çalışkanım!' will echo the mountains. Form the Straits to the Fertile Crescent, the name of Turkey will be accepted as a noble asset. I am here to rule over my people, and craft my legacy as a knight of Allah. There is no place for pessimism and Nihilism currently. You young generals are all promoted to your upper ranks, and go to the ranksmaster to claim your new badges. Today is a new day in Turkish history, one that will mark the end of the Decline and start the Ascension."\n The soldiers were impressed and complied with the orders, and while they were going to the ranksmaster, one said\n "The Pasha looks healthy now. I am proud!" "

 wrf.1.d:0 "After the Istanbul Treaty was signed, Anatolia fell under foreign hands and mandates. Over time, certain men had to act against this tyranny, one of them being Mustafa Kemal Pasha. \n The Pasha was a known general and a famed social icon in Anatolia thanks to his Turko-centric approach to the Ottoman Empire and his nationalism. After the peninsula fell to Western powers, he gathered his fellow comrades Ismet, Fevzi, Kazım and Enver. His relationship with Enver was tacky since they only cooperated to repel back the Europeans. In 1925, the pashas and their militants were planning their uprising in Ankara, just to be busted in by the British colonial police force. The infiltrator was never found, but many rumors spread around on it's identity. During the raid, Kemal and a big portion of his generals and militants succeded in their escape, leaving behind Enver and his clique of militants. Arrested by the British, Enver is exiled to Ukraine, where he spent some years as a colonel. \n After the incident, the generals, now known as the Kemalists, have scattered all around Anatolia. Ismet in Thrace, Fevzi in Adana and Orbay in Ankara. Kemal was around Manisa, a small city close to Smyrna. Between 1927 and 1933, the Kemalists have made significant gains in guerilla warfare and raids after the colonial hold in Greek occupied regions faded away because of the nation's economic and political problems. Now occupying most of Western Turkey and the conservative regions of Konya, Kemal was prideful only until 1933 where the First Anatolian Crisis happened, where guerilla warfare between General Fuller and the communists in the British Mandate went hot and certain organizations in Anatolia started seceding from their colonial overlords. The secession of the communists gave morale to the reactionary islamists of the Konya region against Kemal's secular leanings, causing the Great Reactionary Revolt. Since Kemal couldn't fight in so many fronts, actively raiding Smyrna, keeping the islamists away from Bursa and safeguarding the borders against any communist bandits, Kemal had to create The Caliphate, an islamic ulema state ruled by the last islamic caliph. This occurance has left a big scar in the Pasha's heart and his fuel to unify Turkey under his vision started burn much more. Now in 1936, The Pasha has the Linguist movement, a radical Anti-Kemalist movement with totalitarian and militaristic aims, to contain and a final battle to fight in Smyrna. The British Mandate is not really stable and the atrocities commited in Antalya will be used as claims to absorb the Roatta Legion into the Kemalist Order with D'Annunzio's own help. Only god knows what seeks ahead."

Over time, certain men had to act against this tyranny, one of them being Ismail Enver Pasha. \n The Pasha was a known general, CUP leader but had issues with popularity amongst the older generation for his failures in The Great War and The Balkan Wars. After the peninsula fell to Western powers, he cooperated with his ex-comrades, the Kemalists, consisting of Kemal himself, Ismet, Fevzi and Orbay pashas. His relationship with Kemal was tacky since they only cooperated to repel back the Europeans. In 1925, the pashas and their militants were planning their uprising in Ankara, just to be busted in by the British colonial police force. The infiltrator was never found, but many rumors spread around on it's identity. During the raid, Kemal and a big portion of his generals and militants succeded in their escape, leaving behind Enver and his clique of militants. Arrested by the British, Enver is exiled to Ukraine where he joined the Black Army and teached the anarchists the art of war and governence. Always blaming Kemal for his arrest and exile, he moved to the Mountain Republic around 1928, arming the Dagetanis against the Georgian guerillas. After a year in Mountain Republic, Enver moves to Baku, the city that he swore to take with his Caucasian Islamic Army in The Great War. Enver's brother, Nuri Bey, would do anything for his brother's redemption in Anatolia so Enver starts demanding propaganda posters of Turkist and Anti-Armenian actions to be displayed all over Anatolia. Slowly raising a generation of Enver admirers, Nuri Bey becomes a sattelite of Enver in Anatolia. After gaining a big following in Azerbaijan, the Azeri government sends a Armenian hitman to take out Enver, which Enver escapes from and runs away to Trabzon in 1934. Since his arrival in Trabzon, he was welcomed by the local nationalist and conservative folk, and raised a big army from conscripts all around Anatolia and from Trabzon. Re-creating the Caucasian Army as the Caucasian Islamic Brigade, Enver declares total destruction of Armenian occupation over Anatolia in 1 January, 1936. From now on, his goal is to unify Anatolia under his fist and redeem  himself to his people, to pardon all the crimes he commited such as signing the Istanbul Treaty."

 ant.1.t:0 "The Anarchic Mandate"
 ant.1.d:0 "After the British mandate was set up the governors were very happy to govern another useless piece of shit land with no effort but they soon realized they all ended up hanged, dead or taken their own lives.\n The Anatolian Mandate started off as a paradise for European skilled laborers, young British soldiers and European mercenaries with cheap prices, awesome geography and a profitable Black Sea trade route. As time passed, the local Turks were pissed off living under the claws of the British so they started organizing. Organizations mostly consisted of young students and old war veterans and aimed attacks on British soldiers and assets in the region. In a short time these organizations became extremist political entities, such as Ethem Nejat's TKP with a militant Unisocialist outlook or Nazım's Maoist guerillas in the mountains. To combat this epidemic of political guerillas, the Mandate commisioned a marshall to lead the armies of the colony in order to eliminate them. \n J.F.C Fuller was chosen as the marshall. A occultist, far-right symphatizer with a good history with tank warfare and usage of chemicals. From the day he set foot on the Mandate, the region changed forever. Fuller formed his political cult amongst nationalist European laborers, soldiers, some mercenaries and influenced some politicans in the Collabration Government. Fuller made his tactics more radical over time, creating new forms of guerilla warfare, razing of entire villages and experimentation of new chemical weapons, which destroyed his skin and mentla health over time. In 1933, the First Anatolian Crisis happened which the battle between the Communists and Fuller went hot. Fuller had no regrets and threatened to destroy the entire city of Sinop which was a hotbed of the Mandate so the government stopped attacks on the guerillas, which ended the conflict and secured peace. Understanding how risky is it to give Fuller complete military command, the government commisioned Mad Jack, a famed British mercenary, to come command the European mercenaries in the mandate. Jack accepted, and quickly became a figure for apolitical Turks and mercenaries. Now in 1936, Fuller plans a coup against the government. Will the government concede into chaos, or will they give it to Fuller to fix the mess?"

Not long after his arrival, he was dropped of in the center of the village, seemingly beaten and covered in blood.
