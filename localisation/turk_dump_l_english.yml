 enver.5.d:0 "Enver woke up earlier than his colleagues and the whole unit. Getting dressed in a shiny black uniform  tailored by a German designer during the war, he headed out, wandering through the barracks to reach the command room. This former Ottoman prision in Van was still rusty, only recently being turned into a military building.  The Pasha sighed with bitternes, seeing how his once proud army was reduced to guaridng rotting buildings. While he was walking, he heard  noises coming from the command room. In anticipation of a hostile encounter, he grabbed his knife and a pistol, as the Caucasian tradition taught. Enver  blasted the door open to see Samet, his right hand man messing with maps and intel gathered from the Armenian bandits. Enver quickly grabbed him, shaking him for the explantion of his behaviour. The officers were not allowed to wake up until the Pasha did, much less enter the command room without his permision. \n 'I was crafting a plan, my Pasha!' said Samet, angrily staring at the Pasha. 'Then instead of walking in the command room like some illiterate Armenian thug, you'd better tell me if this 'plan' of yours is worth it!' Enver replied. Samet took his notebook and showed his war plans to the Pasha. \n 'You see my Pasha, the conquest of Eastern Turkish and Armenian territories have granted us strategic power in the mountains and Caucasus. Our state's greater ambition is to re-unify Anatolia into a strong Turkish nation, and doing so would require much more territory and resources. My plan is to strike south. at the  loose confederation of Kurdish tribes, named the Ashirats. Their central authority is non-existent, not to mention that their traditionalist outlook on militarism forces them to act like some lycee bully instead of a proper fighting force. We should seize their lands, use their men and women as slave workers, assimilate their children into our creed, exploit their agriculture and show them the real Turkish force.'\n Enver listened to his plan in admiration and geniunity. Even though he thought some terms that Samet used were radical, like forced slavery, he wasn't a very different man after all. 'You're pretty good. now go and wake up the shock troopers, raze those Zagros rats!' the pasha exclaimed with  the last shreds of joy that he still has in his older  years.\nSamet was gaining influence in the military academy, and now to be admired by the Pasha himself. Only time could tell what would happen."

 tur.1.d:0 "As the morning sun was shining across Istanbul, Mustafa Kemal was enjoying the view while taking a sip of coffee in the Dolmabahçe Palace. Despite hearing a knock on the door it didn’t disturb his calm.\n„Come in.” said the Pasha. His tone still being smooth, even though his throat was afflicted by his recent disease and years of fighting to mend a broken nation together. The doctors told him to relax but today was only a brief moment of  respite, there was still much to do. The issues of sectarian violence, new constitution, workers’ rights, female suffrage, new army laws and countless others couldn’t allow for Kemal to just rest.\n„Sir, is everything alright?” Ismet Inonu waited patiently for the Pasha to notice his entrance.\n„The fate of the nation is at stake. We may have won the war against Enver and other traitors, but there are still many issues plaguing Turkey. I can’t allow myself to sit and relax while the nation suffers, as those pathetic doctors  suggest. I am a statesman first, I would give my life for the nation if need be!” Mustafa Kemal exclaimed with a vigor not of an old and tired politician, but a young and charismatic leader.\n„Sir, I came here to take your orders on the matter of security in the eastern provinces.  Will the local police be enough or are we to send military forces to keep order? I am sure you would rather delegate this matter to your  subordinates, since dealing with the sickness must be ve-” right as the word sickness escaped Ismet’s mouth he heard a cane strike the floor.\n„Sickness, what sickness? Throughout this whole year I was active on the front lines, leading my men to glory, sharing their burdens. And now that the country is barely unified my council thinks I’m too ill to continue my work! I will n-”  the Pasha suddenly felt weak and was caught by Ismet before collapsing.\n„Kemal, listen to me. We all have seen those bloodied napkins, your sudden bouts of coughing, the empty cigar boxes and new diary entries. We do not wish for you to end like an old and powerless man, but you have to understand that if you continue like this there will be no one to lead Turkey!”\nThe Pasha was disappointed. Chiefly with himself for allowing his ailing state to show. But this only strengthened his resolve to go forth with the work his entire life was spent on. “Ismet, you are going east together with the soldiers,  aren’t you? Tell the staff to make my suit ready and inform the soldiers they will have an extra passenger. I have sworn to lead this nation and I will not stop until I breathe my last breath!”"

Due to the Italian civil war and economic downturn caused by the collapse of the united states, our once prosperous tourism industry collapsed. Since the colony couldn't run on bananas alone a new source of income was gravely needed. With our homeland in political turmoil and the colony bleeding cash, an "unusual" source of income was founded by the then newly appointed governor-general Mario Roatta. Ever since Roatta's appointment the colony has been turning a profit despite the lack of tourism, and while it is difficult to explain why there are so many ghost towns, and why Turkish guerilla fighters have increased exponentially under Roatta, as long as nothing major happens and the colony keeps turning a profit our homeland will continue to live in blissful ignorance"
