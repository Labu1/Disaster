russia.1.t:0 "The Status Quo"
russia.1.d:0 "It was a busy day in the Moscow streets, although the morning haze had laid itself down on the city, giving it a lazy atmosphere more befitting of some dreary town in the English countryside then Russia. The paperboys yelled out the morning headline, although befitting to the sleepy nature of this day, it was nothing out of the ordinary. Some local businessman, who's name would go anonymous, had unfortunately tripped and fell and landed directly on his neck while he had tried to pull up his pants. The crowds walked by, unassuming and unaware, especially of the five men who walked towards the central command building in Moscow. They were dressed in leather jackets and flat caps, a common sight in any of Russia's urban centres, and carrying packages filled with an unknown material. Deliverymen were by no means a rare sight, and their official and authoritative posture indicated that they had a purpose and a definite destination, rather then simply walking to a cafe or workplace. Their stride quickened as they passed the central command building, leaving behind a convenient and neat stack of packages addressed to the very building in which they stood in front of. None of the pedestrians surrounding the gate questioned the men, and the day went on normally as it would have any other day. Then, a flash, a bang, the front gates to the central command center were completely dissolved like water to paper, and the five men, who had taken a loop around the building until the time came, rushed into the government office. Many shots were heard in an instant, and just as quickly as it had began, those 5 men left the scene with pistols in hand and documents in the other. The people panicked, terrorism as such was familiar to those military men who had been stationed in the regions where Red and Left Guerrillas still roamed free, but in Moscow? It was almost unheard of, and in the comotion, those five men sunk back into the hazy, lazy day on those city streets, which had just become a little bit more dangerous. They were members of the Socialist Revolutionaries, and their time would come."
russia.1.a:0 "Oh..."

russia.2.t:0 "The Color Red"
russia.2.d:0 "Blood, guts, all that lovely stuff! Spread all over the lands of Russia in the futile mission to deprive the people of their will. Death follows in the wake of the White Army as their march towards oblivion nears, they shoot all the men they see who dare even bleed red. A purge of unearthly proportions, but why? Why must all the sons of Russia die, to satisfy the fears and paranoia of a drunk dictator? Decay, rot, it is everywhere, the fields lie untoiled and soiled as the men wished for land, the factories lay empty as the men wished for bread, and the colleges fall dark as the men wished for peace. The actions of the sinner, the great dictator of Russia, shall never be forgiven. Choose wisely! Who does history favour? The oppressor, or the oppressed? The purge shall continue for now, but soon Avalov shall meet a most deserving fate. Oh glorious death, why must we wait for your call?"
russia.2.a:0 "Purging is sustainable, right?"

russia.3.t:0 "Damnation to Democracy!"
russia.3.d:0 "The Duma is not a democratic institution in the true sense of the word, in fact many could see it closer to an oligarchical grouping then any sort of true Parliament. However, the Duma is also made up of men who, despite all of their fallings and failures, are not idiots. They realized that Avalovs' purge cannot be a sustainable means of conducting a country, and the population already loathes the government for its failures to industrialize or improve the nation in any sense of the word. So the Duma put forward a simple bill, the detainment, repression, and oppression of any group within Russia must first and foremost be passed and approved by the Duma, rather then through the autonomous action of the head of state. Saying Avalov did not react well to this is an understatement the size of Siberia, his blood boiled at the news, how dare those conniving bastards even think of trying to cross me? I was the one who gave them their jobs, I paid out the bribes, I rigged the elections, it was me dammit! They dare to protect the lives of some Red bastards just to, in their words, maintain stability? I'll show them some fucking stability! Avalov grabbed his pistol and his phone, both of which in recent weeks had seen plenty of use, but then slowly lowered them. Should I exercise some restraint? The Duma is the centre of my legitimacy, as poor as it is, and without it I am nothing but a dictator in the eyes of the people. Those snivelling commies had forced my hand, I had to maintain that wretched emblem of democracy even though it had cost him nothing but pain. But now was also the perfect opportunity, two birds with one stone, kill the Duma and continue the purge. The man sat in his chair, swivelling around to allow his mind the leisure of distraction, and to flood his thoughts into a space where they could be logically processed without unneeded burden."
russia.3.a:0 "Purge the Duma, but don't abolish it"
russia.3.b:0 "To hell with the Duma, I am the state!"

russia.4.t:0 "Consequences"
russia.4.d:0 "So, perhaps dissolving the Duma was a slightly hasty idea. This was the thought that crossed the mind of Avalov as the severed head of the police chief of Moscow was thrown over his palace walls. The people have erupted into massive riots across the nation, it turns out that the Duma really was the only thing between Avalov and political oblivion, but he was too far in to back out now. The people wanted his blood, the nation was again on fire, and civil war seemed like a distinct possibility, and it is all your fault. Thousands may die in these riots, but millions will die because of your actions, and you will never think anything of it, you're just a King playing with the lives of his countrymen like pawns. Death, destruction, rape, murder, it is entirely on Avalov, and whatever being chose to put him in power in the first place."
