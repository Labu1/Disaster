pre.1.t:0 "Preußen Erwache"
pre.1.d:0 "In the aftermath of the collapse of the Paris Peace Conference and the French occupation of the west bank of the Rhine, the failure to defend the Rhineland from an invasion that blatantly violated the Armistice was the last nail in the coffin for the already impoverished and chaotic republic, and Ebert didn't bother resisting when reactionary Junkers, with the backing of the Army and Freikorps, marched into Berlin, creating a new regime under the rightist beureaucrat Wolfgang Kapp. However, the putschists were hated by much of the population and lacked the resources to consolidate power across the country, and leftist uprisings broke out in much of Germany, cutting off the main Putschist forces in Prussia. In spite of this, separate Bavarian Freikorps units under Franz Ritter von Epp and Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, among others, were able to restore a reactionary government under the conservative Gustav Kahr, and this regime proceeded to aid rightists in the neighbouring states of Baden and Wurtemberg restore their own monarchies. Although the Prussian regime celebrated this, hoping that the rightists in Southern Germany would reuinte with them, Kahr, a strong regionalist, proclaimed an independent Bavarian state instead, while the socialists managed to secure their grip over the north-west, and local Freikorps units in Mecklenburg and Saxony also asserted their independence, and the Danes occupied the Kiel canal.\n\Left with only Prussia, a broken Kapp was forced to resign by the very same aristocrats and officers who had put him in power a matter of months. Since then, the subsequently proclaimed Prussian republic has seen its politics dominated by the Junkers and their allies, with many accusing the state of operating a mere sham democracy, with a succession of Chancellors all answering to and working with the same aristocratic cliques. However, the current Chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher, is known to be more blatantly authoritarian, militaristic, and pro-worker than the Junkers, alongside his reputation for political intrigues. In oposition to the Junker government are the reformists of the Nationale Liberale Partei, which was re-established by Prussian liberals after initially falling apart after the collapse of the German Empire. Despite their staunch support for democracy, they also take a determined Pan-Germanist stance, dreaming of the day when all Germans are united under one flag. Meanwhile, the Junkers' failure to either restore the Hohenzollern monarchy or make any effective moves to restore German pride has galvanised opposition on the right as well. Both Alfred Hugenberg's reactionary monarchist DNVP and the Alldeutsch Nationale Partei, formed by Herman von Goring after Kahr had him exiled from Bavaria for his pan-Germanism and extremism, are harsh critics of the status quo."
pre.1.a:0 "What lies in store for the nation next?"

pre.2.t:0 "The Corruption Report"
pre.2.d:0 "For some time, corruption has been a rampant problem in the Prussian administration, and, to appease criticism from the opposition, Schliecher commissioned a report on corruption in the state in October od 1935. Today, the finished report reached Schleicher's desk, and, although we knew it would look bad, nobody was prepared for this.\n\The report implicates all but the etnirety of the Prussian  state, laying bare the shakey apparatus of manipulation and intimidation that has propelled the Junkers' favoured candidates to successive election victories, and exposing Schleicher's own unscrupulous methods.\n\Until we find a way to wrap this up in safer terms for the public, and resolve the countless disputes within the government that this will cause, we must hope that it can stay secret."
pre.2.a:0 "Let's keep this wrapped up..."

pre.3.t:0 "The Junkers' Ultimatum"
pre.3.d:0 "With the protests enveloping Berlin, a number of prominent Junkers today met with Kurt von Schleicher, demanding that he take responsibility for the corruption and step down, arguing that only this can preserve the republic. They are proposing that Schliecher make way for Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, a Junker conservative from Saxony, who found himself in Prussia amidst the chaos of 1919, and proceeded to build a significant career there. Initially a member of the DNVP, he broke with the party over Hugenberg's radicalism, making him a trustworthy candidate in the eyes of the Junkers.\n\However, Schleicher has been planning for some time to make his own move at consolidating power, forming a so-callled "Querfront" coalition of nationalist and pro-worker parties to oppose Goring and Hugenberg, and also bypass the Junkers' power. Perhaps, this is his opportunity to do just that."
pre.3.a:0 "For the sake of the republic, I must resign"
pre.3.b:0 "The Junkers can go to hell!"

pre.4.t:0 "Hindenburg's Proposal"
pre.4.d:0 "Elections in Prussia have, since the birth of the repbulic, all but guaranteed victories for the Junkers' favoured candidated, through he liberal use of manipulation and intimidation. Today, Oskar von indenburg, a prominent member of the Camarilla and son of the great Field Marshal, met with Goerdeler to outline his proposals to do much the same in the coming election, lest the radicals take advantage of the scandal to make significant gains. Although this would secure our ability to hold on to power and pursue our own goals, others fear that such a move will only spur on Goring and Hugenberg."
pre.4.a:0 "Go ahead"
pre.4.b:0 "This would only fuel the protests"

pre.5.t:0 "The Elections"
pre.5.d:0 "Today, the citizens of Prussia will go to the polls again, this time in an election notably free of the conventional rigging and manipulation. As such, many are expecting a shakeup in the results, and potentially an unprecedented victory for the opposition, although the people may still look to the Junkers for stability."
pre.5.a:0 "Goring and the AdNP come out on top"
pre.5.b:0 "Hugenberg's DNVP secure a lead"
pre.5.c:0 "A resurgent NLP sees off radical threats"
pre.5.d:0 "The Junkers' candidates hold on"

pre.6.t:0 "Election Victory"
pre.6.d:0 "Today, the citizens of Prussia voted in new elections, granting a clear majority in the Reichstag to the Junkers' candidates, and giving Goerdeler a firm hand to lead the nation out of the crisis and chaos. Although the opposition is alleging extensive rigging and manipulation in the voting process, most citizens seem simply glad that the political chaos is receding."
pre.6.a:0 "All as planned"

pre.7.t:0 "Rumours of a Coup"
pre.7.d:0 "With Schleicher having refused to resign, and instead pinned the blame for the corruption on the Junkers themselves, Prussia's traditional elite are now furious, with Goerdeler demanding from the Reichstag that Schleicher make way, while the opposition siezes on the clear division in the government. Now, rumours are reaching Schleicher's office of a possible putsch by the Junkers and their allies, and many are urging him to act."
pre.7.a:0 "These are just rumours, we can't do anything drastic"
pre.7.b:0 "We have to crack down on the Junkers"

pre.8.t:0 "The Junkers' Putsch
pre.8.d:0 "Today, our worst fears came to pass, and units of the Prussian army, commanded by Erwin von Witzleben, stormed Berlin. The surrounded Reichstag hastily voted for the formation of a new National Unity Government under Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, while Schleicher was forced to stand down in the Chancellory, before being led away to a secure prison, where he will await trial for corruption, and, potentially, treason. Meanwhile, a speech by Goerdeler to the nation over the radio has confirmed the largely peaceful siezure of power, and it is clear that the Junkers are safely back in control of Prussia."
pre.8.a:0 "So be it..."

pre.9.t:0 "Purging the Junkers"
pre.9.d:0 "Having resolved to crack down on the Junkers, we must now set about securing our position, and it is thus necessary to start purging the Junker cliques that have controlled the government for so long. As such, many are urging Schliecher to arrange the assasination of Goerdeler, to cut the Junker camarilla off from its most obvious figurehead. Others, meanwhile are urging that this doesn't go nearly far enough, and that with the Junkers now beginning to form an alliance of necesssisty with Goring and the AdNP, we may need to declare martial law outright."
pre.9.a:0 "Declare Martial Law"
pre.9.b:0 "Assasinate Goerdeler"

pre.10.t:0 "The Death of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler"
pre.10.d:0 "Today in Berlin, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was shot in the street from a passing car. He died very quickly, but his death has thrown Berlin into crisis, and it seems his assasination has had quite the opposite effect to that which we intended. Already, prominent Junkers are accusing us of having murdered him, and it is understood that the late Paul von Hindenburg's son, Oskar, a notable camarilla politician, has been meeting with Herman Goring, seeking to co-ordinate actions against Schleicher. The future of the government seems anything but secure."
pre.10.a:0 "OOh dear..."

pre.11.t:0 "The Purge Succeeds"
pre.11.d:0 "In the past days, countless notable Junkers, including every notable member of the old camarilla, have been rounded up and imprisoned by the police force, with Schleicher's hold on the country being greatly consolidated. With Goerdeler, Oskar von Hindeburg, and countless other Junker politicians safely behind bars, we need no longer worry about the threat posed by the aristicratic conservatvies, and can focus on negotiating a Querfront coalition."
pre.11.a:0 "Good"

pre.12.t:0 "The Goring Putsch"
pre.12.d:0 "Something about cooperation with the junkers"
pre.12.a:0 "Work With Them"
pre.12.b:0 "Consolidate Our Power"

pre.13.t:0 "Junker Coups Goring"

pre.16.a:0 "Ok"

pre.17.a:0 "Good"
