pre.1.t:0 "Preußen Erwache"
pre.1.d:0 "In the aftermath of the collapse of the Paris Peace Conference and the French occupation of the west bank of the Rhine, the failure to defend the Rhineland from an invasion that blatantly violated the Armistice was the last nail in the coffin for the already impoverished and chaotic republic, and Ebert didn't bother resisting when reactionary Junkers, with the backing of the Army and Freikorps, marched into Berlin, creating a new regime under the rightist beureaucrat Wolfgang Kapp. However, the putschists were hated by much of the population and lacked the resources to consolidate power across the country, and leftist uprisings broke out in much of Germany, cutting off the main Putschist forces in Prussia. In spite of this, separate Bavarian Freikorps units under Franz Ritter von Epp and Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, among others, were able to restore a reactionary government under the conservative Gustav Kahr, and this regime proceeded to aid rightists in the neighbouring states of Baden and Wurtemberg restore their own monarchies. Although the Prussian regime celebrated this, hoping that the rightists in Southern Germany would reuinte with them, Kahr, a strong regionalist, proclaimed an independent Bavarian state instead, while the socialists managed to secure their grip over the north-west, and local Freikorps units in Mecklenburg and Saxony also asserted their independence, and the Danes occupied the Kiel canal.\nLeft with only Prussia, a broken Kapp was forced to resign by the very same aristocrats and officers who had put him in power a matter of months. Since then, the subsequently proclaimed Prussian republic has seen its politics dominated by the Junkers and their allies, with many accusing the state of operating a mere sham democracy, with a succession of Chancellors all answering to and working with the same aristocratic cliques. However, the current Chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher, is known to be more blatantly authoritarian, militaristic, and pro-worker than the Junkers, alongside his reputation for political intrigues. In oposition to the Junker government are the reformists of the Nationale Liberale Partei, which was re-established by Prussian liberals after initially falling apart after the collapse of the German Empire. Despite their staunch support for democracy, they also take a determined Pan-Germanist stance, dreaming of the day when all Germans are united under one flag. Meanwhile, the Junkers' failure to either restore the Hohenzollern monarchy or make any effective moves to restore German pride has galvanised opposition on the right as well. Both Alfred Hugenberg's reactionary monarchist DNVP and the Alldeutsch Nationale Partei, formed by Herman von Goring after Kahr had him exiled from Bavaria for his pan-Germanism and extremism, are harsh critics of the status quo."
pre.1.a:0 "What lies in store for the nation next?"

pre.2.t:0 "The Corruption Report"
pre.2.d:0 "For some time, corruption has been a rampant problem in the Prussian administration, and, to appease criticism from the opposition, Schleicher commissioned a report on corruption in the state in October od 1935. Today, the finished report reached Schleicher's desk, and, although we knew it would look bad, nobody was prepared for this.\nThe report implicates all but the etnirety of the Prussian  state, laying bare the shakey apparatus of manipulation and intimidation that has propelled the Junkers' favoured candidates to successive election victories, and exposing Schleicher's own unscrupulous methods.\n\Until we find a way to wrap this up in safer terms for the public, and resolve the countless disputes within the government that this will cause, we must hope that it can stay secret."
pre.2.a:0 "Let's keep this wrapped up..."

pre.3.t:0 "The Junkers' Ultimatum"
pre.3.d:0 "With the protests enveloping Berlin, a number of prominent Junkers today met with Kurt von Schleicher, demanding that he take responsibility for the corruption and step down, arguing that only this can preserve the republic. They are proposing that Schliecher make way for Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, a Junker conservative from Saxony, who found himself in Prussia amidst the chaos of 1919, and proceeded to build a significant career there. Initially a member of the DNVP, he broke with the party over Hugenberg's radicalism, making him a trustworthy candidate in the eyes of the Junkers.\n\However, Schleicher has been planning for some time to make his own move at consolidating power, forming a so-callled "Querfront" coalition of nationalist and pro-worker parties to oppose Goring and Hugenberg, and also bypass the Junkers' power. Perhaps, this is his opportunity to do just that."
pre.3.a:0 "For the sake of the republic, I must resign"
pre.3.b:0 "The Junkers can go to hell!"

pre.4.t:0 "Hindenburg's Proposal"
pre.4.d:0 "Elections in Prussia have, since the birth of the repbulic, all but guaranteed victories for the Junkers' favoured candidated, through he liberal use of manipulation and intimidation. Today, Oskar von indenburg, a prominent member of the Camarilla and son of the great Field Marshal, met with Goerdeler to outline his proposals to do much the same in the coming election, lest the radicals take advantage of the scandal to make significant gains. Although this would secure our ability to hold on to power and pursue our own goals, others fear that such a move will only spur on Goring and Hugenberg."
pre.4.a:0 "Go ahead"
pre.4.b:0 "This would only fuel the protests"

pre.5.t:0 "The Elections"
pre.5.d:0 "Today, the citizens of Prussia will go to the polls again, this time in an election notably free of the conventional rigging and manipulation. As such, many are expecting a shakeup in the results, and potentially an unprecedented victory for the opposition, although the people may still look to the Junkers for stability."
pre.5.a:0 "Goring and the AdNP come out on top"
pre.5.b:0 "Hugenberg's DNVP secure a lead"
pre.5.c:0 "A resurgent NLP sees off radical threats"
pre.5.d:0 "The Junkers' candidates hold on"

pre.6.t:0 "Election Victory"
pre.6.d:0 "Today, the citizens of Prussia voted in new elections, granting a clear majority in the Reichstag to the Junkers' candidates, and giving Goerdeler a firm hand to lead the nation out of the crisis and chaos. Although the opposition is alleging extensive rigging and manipulation in the voting process, most citizens seem simply glad that the political chaos is receding."
pre.6.a:0 "All as planned"

pre.7.t:0 "Rumours of a Coup"
pre.7.d:0 "With Schleicher having refused to resign, and instead pinned the blame for the corruption on the Junkers themselves, Prussia's traditional elite are now furious, with Goerdeler demanding from the Reichstag that Schleicher make way, while the opposition siezes on the clear division in the government. Now, rumours are reaching Schleicher's office of a possible putsch by the Junkers and their allies, and many are urging him to act."
pre.7.a:0 "These are just rumours, we can't do anything drastic"
pre.7.b:0 "We have to crack down on the Junkers"

pre.8.t:0 "The Junkers' Putsch"
pre.8.d:0 "Today, our worst fears came to pass, and units of the Prussian army, commanded by Erwin von Witzleben, stormed Berlin. The surrounded Reichstag hastily voted for the formation of a new National Unity Government under Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, while Schleicher was forced to stand down in the Chancellory, before being led away to a secure prison, where he will await trial for corruption, and, potentially, treason. Meanwhile, a speech by Goerdeler to the nation over the radio has confirmed the largely peaceful siezure of power, and it is clear that the Junkers are safely back in control of Prussia."
pre.8.a:0 "So be it..."

pre.9.t:0 "Purging the Junkers"
pre.9.d:0 "Having resolved to crack down on the Junkers, we must now set about securing our position, and it is thus necessary to start purging the Junker cliques that have controlled the government for so long. As such, many are urging Schliecher to arrange the assasination of Goerdeler, to cut the Junker camarilla off from its most obvious figurehead. Others, meanwhile are urging that this doesn't go nearly far enough, and that with the Junkers now beginning to form an alliance of necesssisty with Goring and the AdNP, we may need to declare martial law outright."
pre.9.a:0 "Assasinate Goerdeler"
pre.9.b:0 "Declare Martial Law"

pre.10.t:0 "The Death of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler"
pre.10.d:0 "Today in Berlin, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was shot in the street from a passing car. He died very quickly, but his death has thrown Berlin into crisis, and it seems his assasination has had quite the opposite effect to that which we intended. Already, prominent Junkers are accusing us of having murdered him, and it is understood that the late Paul von Hindenburg's son, Oskar, a notable camarilla politician, has been meeting with Herman Goring, seeking to co-ordinate actions against Schleicher. The future of the government seems anything but secure."
pre.10.a:0 "Oh dear..."

pre.11.t:0 "The Purge Succeeds"
pre.11.d:0 "In the past days, countless notable Junkers, including every notable member of the old camarilla, have been rounded up and imprisoned by the police force, with Schleicher's hold on the country being greatly consolidated. With Goerdeler, Oskar von Hindeburg, and countless other Junker politicians safely behind bars, we need no longer worry about the threat posed by the aristicratic conservatvies, and can focus on negotiating a Querfront coalition."
pre.11.a:0 "Excllent"

pre.12.t:0 "The Goring Putsch"
pre.12.d:0 "Tiday, our worst fears came to pass, as uniformed supporters of Herman von Goring and the AdNP, alongside units of the army still loyal to the Junkers, commanded by Erwin von Witzleben, stormed Berlin. The soldiers forced their way into the Reichstag, where Oskar von Hindenburg promptly condemned the Schleicher regime as traitors to Prussia, and demanded an extra-legal motion to proclaim a new Government of National Unity and Salvation, representing both the Junkers and the AdNP.With the Chancellory surrounded, Schleicher himself surrendered 2 hours later, and was quietly taken to a secure prison, where he shall await trial for treason while his allies are unceremoniously disposed of.\nNow, Herman von Goring finds himself at last in control of Prussia, but his grip is nevertheless a fragile one, with the Junkers' influence strong as ever within the unity government. As such, we are now facing calls from the military and moderates in the Party to try to continue working with the Junkers, in the hope of better uniting the nation. Others, however, are urging that Goring should take the opportunity to further consolidate his own power, forcing the Junkers to submit."
pre.12.a:0 "We need to work together"
pre.12.b:0 "The Junkers' loyalty must be guaranteed"

pre.13.t:0 "Goring Outmaneuvered"
pre.13.d:0 "In the past days, in the absence of any effort from Goring and the AdNP to reign in the Junkers' influence, they have gradually re-exerted their power all across Prussia, disarming local branches of the AdNP and securing the grip of loyal military units over the nation's security. This came to a head today, when Oskar von Hindenburg announced to the Reichstag, seemingly without even consulting Goring, that the unity government had come to an end, and that Goring's term in office was over. With the Chancellory sounded by pro-Junker soldiers for the second time recently, Goring had little choice but to submit, and forlornly confirmed his resignation. Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag unanimously nominated von Hindeburg as the new Chancellor of Germany. Although recent months have been tough, decent governance has at last been restored to Germany."
pre.13.a:0 "Hurrah!"

pre.14.t:0 "The Day at Potsdam"
pre.14.d:0 "Over the past days, Goring has greatly moved to extend his own influence, at the expense of the Junkers. By replacing Junker-aligned military garrisons with AdNP militants, alongside replacing Junkers in local governments and stacking the cabinet with AdNP loyalists, Goring has gone some way towards consolidating power, and has clearly greatly intimidated the Junkers, who today agreed to meet with Goring and other AdNP leaders at Potsdam.\nAt this "Day at Potsdam", as it has been dubbed by the press, the Junkers were clearly forced to recognise that their ability to continue their own government over Prussia is over, and that they have little choice but to co-operate with Goring, in exchange for very limited concessions in the countryside and agriculture. The message is clear: Prussia has one leader, and that man is Herman von Goring."
pre.14.a:0 "Heil Goring!"

pre.15.t:0 "The Negotiations Reach an Impasse"
pre.15.d:0 "Over the past days, we have been negotiating with numerous lefist and nationalist movements, from the remnants of the Social Democras to the discontented leftwing of the AdNP, to try to form a new Querfront coalition in the Reichstag, able to support Schleicher against Goring and Hugenberg and allowing Schleicher to bypass the Junkers in governnance, finally breaking their grip over power.\nHowever, the negotiations have reached a clear impasse, with the disparate factions that Schleicher seeks to incroporate struglling to find much common ground, and increasingly bickering rather than bothering to try. As such, some aides are now urging Schleicher to use some few carefully-placed threats and intimidation to force the parties into co-operation, although others argue that they'll soon sort themselves out."
pre.15.a:0 "They'll get their act together, given time"
pre.15.b:0 "We need to ensure their collaboration, whatever it takes"

pre.16.t:0 "The Negotiations Collapse"
pre.16.d:0 "Today, with the different factions Schleicher had hoped to unite unable to find sufficient common ground, and the previous deadlock having failed to be resolved, the representatives of the various parties unceremoniously walked out of the talks. What remains of the Junkers' political influence has by now been subsumed by the AdNP, with the aristocrats seeing Goring as a better alternative to the "crypto-socialist" Schleicher. Meanwhile, our chances of gaining any support among leftist or centrist movements have come to nothing. Whatever is next in store for Prussia, Schleicher's days are clearly numbered..."
pre.16.a:0 "Scheisse!"

pre.17.t:0 "The Negotiations Succeed"
pre.17.d:0 "Today, in the aftermath of some liberal use of intimidation by Schleicher's allies in the Abwehr, the various parties that he had been seeking to unite into a Querfront against the nationalists and Junkers finally agreed to formalise their coalition in the Reichstag, forming the new government of the Republic of Prussia. With a newfound loyal majority in the Reichstag, Schleicher now has a free hand to pursue his policies, and it won't be long before Hugenburg, Goring, and the reactionary aristocrats are gone for good."
pre.17.a:0 "Hurrah!"

pre.18.t:0 "Schleicher Addresses the Reichstag"
pre.18.d:0 "Today, President Kurt von Schleicher spoke to the assembled Reichstag, inaugurating its annual session. Promising the Prussian people new rural investments and "a calm, repsonsible government, as suits our nation", it was widely believed that Schleicher's speech was mostly written by Junker aides, representing the reactionary aristocrats who have all but controlled successive Prussian governments, and see Schleicher's as no different: something that he is understood to be deeply dissatsifed with. Nonetheless, the speech was broadly well reicived, drawing reluctant applause even from the hardline nationalist and reformist liberals present, and praised by the press. Surely, if there's one thing we can count on, it's a stable political scene."
pre.18.a:0 "Very well"

pre.19.t:0 "Attacking the AdNP"
pre.19.d:0 "For years, Prussia's various governments have, behind the facade of democracy, employed a signifcant amount of manipulation and intimidation to keep the opposition firmly out of power, and now is no different. With Herman Goring's Alldeutsche Nationale Partei rapidly gaining traction among disillusioned nationalists and young army officers, Schleicher's allies in the Abwehr have come to us with a new proposal to undermine these dangerous extremists.\nThe national bolshevik theorist Ernst Niekisch played a crucial role in the founding of the party, seeing the Prussian ethos of the more conventional nationalist Goring as a shift in the right direction towards a nationalist and socialist Germany. Predictably, his left wing of the party has come into much conflict with the party's aristocratic and corporatist mainstream. As such, the Abwehr is suggesting that we meet in secret with Niekisch's allies, to sow greater dissatisfaction with Goring among the AdNP's left wing. Nonetheless, many Junkers are concerned that in strenghtening Niekisch we may simply create another powerful opposition movement that will cause probelms for us later on."
pre.19.a:0 "It's not worth the effort"
pre.19.b:0 "Go ahead"
