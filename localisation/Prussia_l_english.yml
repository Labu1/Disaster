PRE_start_focus:0"Adress the Reichstag"
PRE_start_focus_desc:0"As the new year begins, it is time for Chancellor von Schleicher, now entering the third year of his rule, to prepare to speak to the Reichstag, in an annual address on the state of the Republic, and his proposed policies. Although it is unlikely that he will be entirely in control of what he will say, a succesful speech is nonetheless anticipated, a sure sign of a stabilising political scene."
PRE_invest_in_country_side:0"Invest in the Countryside"
PRE_invest_in_country_side_desc:0"The countryside is nothing less than the heart and soul of the Prussian nation, containing all the excellent traditions and values that our government is founded upon, and of course being home to the Junkers' sprawling estates, and the source of their fortunes. By further investing in rural areas, we shall be able to further consolidate our political position, and boost the economy."
PRE_undermine_goring:0"Undermine Goring"
PRE_undermine_goring_desc:0"Despite the apparent stabilisation of the political scene, with increased acceptance of Junker domination in politics, Herman von Goring and the extreme nationalist AdNP continue to pose a potential threat to our government, in spite of factionalism within the party. It is thus time to task the Abwehr with finding new ways of subtly striking at these untrustworthy extremists."
PRE_react_to_investigation:0"React to the Scandal"
PRE_react_to_investigation_desc:0"What had seemed to be the most stable period in the Republic's history now lies in ruins before us, chaotically shattered to pieces by the leaking of the report. As we do what little we can to quell the protests, and gradually rebuild our fragile coalition in the Reichstag in the aftermath of countless deputies abandoning us for the DNVP or NLP, we shall have to work out who exactly needs to take the blame for the chaos."
PRE_goerdeler_in_charge:0"Goerdeler in Charge"
PRE_goerdeler_in_charge_desc:0"His career shattered by the scandal, Kurt von Schleicher has been forced out of power by the Junkers, who have put in his place Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, a respected administrator and economist, who, despite earlier links with the DNVP, has emerged as an admired moderate within the Camarilla. Hopefully, this change in leadership will prove to be a breath of fresh air for Prussia, and allow us to return a semblance of stability."
PRE_calm_paramilitaries:0"Calm the Paramilitaries"
PRE_calm_paramilitaries_desc:0"Ever since the scandal broke, Goring's blueshirted thugs, the DNVP's Stalhelm League, and liberal members of the Reichsbanner have together engaged often-bloody street fights, each hoping to sieze opportunity of the political chaos. So far, the police's efforts to maintain order have been ineffectual to say the least, but renewed impetus is vital if our government is to last."
PRE_fight_corruption:0"Fight Corruption"
PRE_fight_corruption_desc:0"If we are to regain any facade of legitimacy, we must deal with the issue that provoked the entire crisis: that of corruption. By relieving those worst implicated in the report of their duties, and further investigating suspicious officials, we may be able to convince the public that we are not apathetic to the problem of corruption."
PRE_fresh_elections:0"Fresh Elections"
PRE_fresh_elections_desc:0"With order slowly but surely returning, Goerdeler has resolved to announce a new snap election, in order to ensure the government's mandate and discredit the resurgent opposition. Although Prussian elections have always been characterised by subtle but undeniable intimidation and manipulation of voters, and this time is unlikely to be much different, the scandal is still fresh in the public's memory, and a favourable result is hardly guaranteed."
#schleicher path
PRE_schleicher_holds_on:0"Schleicher Holds On"
PRE_schleicher_holds_on_desc:0"Kurt von Schleicher has astonished both the Junkers and the nation by refusing to accept blame for the report and resign, instead opting to publicly blame Junker dominance of politics itself for corruption, and announce his plans to form a new Querfront coalition of reformist and nationalist movements, capable of opposing the Junkers, reactionaries, and extreme nationalists alike - though time will only tell if such a plan can succeed."
PRE_deal_with_the_junkers:0"Deal With the Junkers"
PRE_deal_with_the_junkers_desc:0"If there is one great and undeniable threat to Schleicher, it is the Junkers, who up to now have all but controlled his own government, and are deeply embittered by his refusal to step down. It's unlikely that, used as they are to essentially unchallenged control over Prussia, they'll take Schleicher's defiance lightly, and we'll have to tread carefully in the coming weeks if our government is to survive."
PRE_negotiate_quer_front:0"Negotiate the Querfront"
PRE_negotiate_quer_front_desc:0"Now that we've put the aristocratic reactionaries in their place, it is time for us to reach out to a braod range of political groups to form the Querfront coalition. Schleicher intends to court Ernst Niekisch's national-bolshevik left wing of the AdNP, the remnants of the social democrats, and smaller nationalist and leftist groups. Although few seriously believe that Schleicher can unify these disparate groups, success will build a new state in Prussia."
PRE_support_the_prussian_worker:0"Support the Prussian Worker"
PRE_support_the_prussian_worker_desc:0"The Prussian nation is not embodied in fat and duplicitous aristocrats and bosses; rather, the spirit of our great nation and people lives in the common man, in the workers and farmers of this great nation, who strive daily for the common benefit of all. It is time for us to appreciate their struggle and sacrifcies, passing sweeping legislation to protect and expand workers' rights in Prussia."
PRE_social_role_army:0"The Social Role of the Army"
PRE_social_role_army_desc:0"If there is one institution in which all of society and the nation is truly united, it is the army. Common service and common struggle for the greatness of the nation brings together men of all classes, backgrounds, and faiths. This solidarity must be extended to broader society, with tightened conscription and militarisation of society ensuring that the entire Prussian nation can be united through and served by its valiant army."
PRE_crush_nationalist_opposition:0"Crush the Nationalist Opposition"
PRE_crush_nationalist_opposition_desc:0"If there is one continuous threat to our regime, it is what remains of the AdNP. Even if Niekisch and the party's left has abandoned the party for our government, Goring remains deeply popular among a broad section of the population, and will only contrinue to undermine the government. By crushing him and his band of charlatans now, we can nip in the bud our main liability, and also set an example to the other traitors that seek to challenge us."
PRE_class_coop:0"Class Cooperation"
PRE_class_coop_desc:0"A nation is equivalent to a great family, and thus its success requires the willing co-operation of all its parts. Although Schleicher and his allies believe strongly in extending greater rights and protection to the workers, we have no intention of embracing Marxist ideas of class struggle. Rather, it is co-operation between the classes, with each social group treated respectfully and fairly, with a proportionate voice in the government, that will make Prussia great."
PRE_unity_through_service:0"Unity Through Service"
PRE_unity_through_service_desc:0"No institution brings the men of this nation together like the army, and as we further consolidate power and push through our reforms, a united and militarised populace is exactly what we need. By ensuring that every man does his part for the Prussian nation, we shall instill a new mutual respect and togetherness in Prussian society, reviving much of the camaraderie of the Great War that many veterans sorely miss."
PRE_undermine_big_business:0"Undermine Big Business"
PRE_undermine_big_business_desc:0"The large businesses in Prussia have long been allied with either Junker or liberal groups, and in the aftermath of our reforms to workers' rights and conditions, have come to greatly resent us, potentially becoming a major liability to the government's stability if they are allowed to continue to freely operate. By intimidating prominent businessmen with threats of far more extensive reforms, and strenghtening the role of government-backed trade unions, we may well be able to whether this storm."
PRE_national_solidarity:0"National Solidarity"
PRE_national_solidarity_desc:0"If the Prussian nation is ever to reclaim its glory, it must stand united. The time for petty class conflicts, for the bosses to sow division through the suppression of workers, and for socialist subverters to spread their sedition, is over. From now on, there will be but one Prussian nation, one whose natural unity and shared aspirations transcend all class divides, and one in which each strives for the beenfit and success of all."
PRE_rejuvenate_militarism:0"Rejuvenate Militarism"
PRE_rejuvenate_militarism_desc:0"As Schleicher further consolidates his power, it is vital that the militaristic values and outlook underpinning much of our agenda, and indeed underpinning the Prussian nation itself throughout its history, are further reinforced and encouraged. By ensuring the role of nationalistic youth movements and furthering our efforts at propagands, we can ensure that the heroic ideals of duty and honour in service to one's nation are never forgotten."
PRE_pro_worker_indus:0"Pro-Worker Industrialisation"
PRE_pro_worker_indus_desc:0"If the Prussian economy is to grow, and indeed if we are to be ready for comong wars, we have no choice but to industrialise. An added benefit of this is that, by shifting the basis of the economy away from the countryside, we shall be able to deal the final, fatal blow to the Junkers' influence, something we can further emphasise by simultaneously strenghtening the role of government-controlled trade unions. By taking away their economic dominance, and strenghening those who have been held under their boots for so long, the Prussian nation will finally be liberated from the Junkers!"
PRE_support_our_countrymen:0"Support Our Countrymen"
PRE_support_our_countrymen_desc:0"As the world situation escalates, seemingly without end, few principles matter more than the solidarity of the entire nation. No longer can Marxist agitators be allowed to spread sedition, and no longer can the richest men at the top be allowed to keep the common man under their boot, only creating more resentment. Instead, every Prussian must support every other, for nothing matters more than the unity of our nation."
PRE_shared_struggle:0"A Shared Struggle"
PRE_shared_struggle_desc:0"It is inevitable that, as war begins to return to Europe, our nation will have to face many bleak struggles. But, with the ideals of Schleicher, Niekisch, and others, of a united and proud nation transcending class divides in place, this struggle will be shared by every Prussian - and so too will the glory of vicotry will be shared by every Prussian. When our borders stretch from Strasbourg to Vienna to Wilhelmshaven to Riga, the glory will belong to us all."
PRE_integrate_querfront_parties:0"Integrate The Querfront Parties"
PRE_integrate_querfront_parties_desc:0"Although Schleicher's regime is by now largely unchallenged, disunity still exists at a lower level, largely between the disparate parties of the Querfront, with centrist social democrats struggling to co-operate with Niekisch's socialist and nationalist faction, and more traditional conservative movements finding little common ground with either. This situation has to change, and so Schleicher has decided to formally merge the Querfront parties into one united government."
PRE_formalise_army_power:0"Formalise The Army's Power"
PRE_formalise_army_power_desc:0"Under Schleicher, the Prussian military, in which he himself built his career, has come to weild an exceptional deal of power, alongside the Querfront coalition in the Reichstag. However, the realities of the constitution, which still maintains a shaky artifice of democracy, have forced the army's power to be kept informal, represented more by backroom deals and political loopholes than open political methods. Now, however, Schleicer has accumulated enough political capital to push through blatantly authoritarian ammendemnts to the constitution, which will allow Prussia's heroic military to aid the nation unencumbered by outdated democracy."
PRE_one_prussian_nation:0"One Prussian Nation"
PRE_one_prussian_nation_desc:0"At last, we have done it. Schleicher and the clique of politicians and generals beneath him, from Niekisch and the national-bolsheviks, who in spite of the loss of their revolutionary zeal have been instrumental in our economic reforms and nationalist revivial, to Braun and the social democrats, who, despite having to accpet much greater authoritarianism than they would have hoped for, have greatly endeared us to many common workers and moderate citizens, and to the nationalist generals who have undertaken major reforms of the army, have finally realised a righteous and just vision of Prussia - a Prussia that is all it should be, and is free, now and forever."
PRE_friends_in_the_abwehr:0"Friends in the Abwehr"
PRE_friends_in_the_abwehr_desc:0"Schleicher has long been friendly with Prussia's intelligence service, the Abwehr, and as he now comes to consolidate power, he will need the backng of his old friends more than ever. It is time for Schleicher to meet with his allies in the service, most notably Hans Oster, to formulate a new strategy whereby the Abwehr's vast resources can be put to use to help him secure his regime."
PRE_clarify_our_policies:0 "Another Reichstag Address"
PRE_clarify_our_policies_desc:0 "It is almost astonishing to think how much has changed since Schleicher last addressed the Reichstag in January. Given how much has happened since then, many of his aides are now arguing that he should make another speech to the increasingly powerless parliament, to outline what exactly it is that the new Querfront government intends to do. However, it is hard to say what exactly that is, and much debate on what the Chancellor should say is sure to follow among the leaders of the different Querfront parties."
PRE_redistribute_land:0 "Redistribute Land"
PRE_redistribute_land_desc:0 "As we increase our aid for Prussia's workers, we must do the same for the farmers of the nation too. Land reform has long been supported by both Niekisch and Braun, and with the two men now extremely powerful in Prussia, both are strongly pressing for it to be implemented. Not only would such a policy strenghten our popularity among common farmers and pay off for the economy, but it would also deal the final blow to the power of the Junkers, something we can hardly turn down.
PRE_a_police_state:0 "A Police State"
PRE_a_police_state_desc:0 "There are few things that are as vital to our continued rule over Prussia as maintaining law and order, something that we shall have to take new special measures to do. With the aid of Oster and the Abwehr, and with the support of both Niekisch and Seldte, Schleicher now intends to pass sweeping legislation empowering the security forces and police to conduct extensive searches and operations against political dissidents, and other subversive criminals. Order alone can save Prussia!"

#Goring
PRE_nazi_victory_focus:0"Goring's Triumph"
PRE_nazi_victory_focus_desc:0"A mere nine years after being first exiled from Bavaria, Goring now finds himself at the helm of the state of Prussia. With his blueshirted supporters celebrating in the streets and members of the opposition hastily trying to get out of the country, it is clear that the face of Prussia will be forever changed by this deeply charismatic Bavarian airman."
PRE_enabling_act:0"The Enabling Act"
PRE_enabling_act_desc:0"The time for weakness, for caution, for the thousand hesitations and cowardices of democracy, is over. The Reichstag must know its place in the new Prussia, and that place is that of a purely advisory body, formed exclusively from trustworthy patriots, and always accountable to the Chancellor. To put this ideal in practice, we must present the Reichstag with an "Enabling Act", using the instability of recent months as a pretext to grant extensive powers to Goring."
PRE_absorb_dnvp:0"Absorb the DNVP"
PRE_absorb_dnvp_desc:0"Alfred Hugenberg's monarchist DNVP does indeed have many commendable qualities. Indeed, they alone stood up for the principles of German nationalism before our party emerged, something that caused them to break spectacularly with the previously sympathetic Junkers. Many in their party are sympathetic to the Goring government, and it is claimed that Hugenberg entertains hopes of managing to enter a coalition with Goring only to outplay him. We should indeed offer a pact to the DNVP, but we know for sure who'll come out on top, and it won't be them."
PRE_restoring_puppet_monarchy:0"Put Auwi on the Throne"
PRE_restoring_puppet_monarchy_desc:0"Although the party is not as a rule sympathetic to Hohenzollern monarchism, and Goring believes that a monarchy on the basis of the Empire of 1871 is outdated and worthless, the old Kaiser's younger son, August Wilhelm, nicknamed Auwi by the press, has proven to be a strong supporter of the movement, believing that he'll be able to curry enough favour with Goring to be placed on the throne. And indeed, making his dreams come true would provide the developing state with a very convenient figurehead, and further legitimise us in the eyes of monarchists and conservatives. The time for a restoration is now!"
PRE_nacht_der_langer_messer:0"Nacht Der Langer Messer"
PRE_nacht_der_langer_messer_desc:0"We may have largely secured power, but our position is still hardly secure. Some Junkers still harbour distate towards Goring's radicalism, many liberals are still organising in the background, and the tension between Goring and Niekisch's left wing of the AdNP is only growing. As such, the only solution is something more radical, more brutal, than ever before. Only the blood of subverters and enemies shall buy Germany's freedom!"
PRE_volkisch_education:0"Volkish Education"
PRE_volkisch_education_desc:0"If our ideals and values are to outlast our own generation, we must ensure that the youth knows them too. As such, we must teacg the true nature and history of the German race, and its place in the world, in every school around the country, and promote the same ideas through youth groups and propaganda. Thus, we shall guarantee the loyalty of the youth, and thus be able to make use of its courage, dynamism, and idealism."
PRE_aryan_studies:0"Aryan Studies"
PRE_aryan_studies_desc:0"As we further emphasise the natural glory of the race, further research to justify our statements and claims is always needed. As such, we should strongly incentivise universities and scholars to further study the history and background of the German race, and, of course, point them in the direction of favourable findings. This will doubtless further legitimise and popularise our actions to assert our rightful place, and also give us greater credence on the world stage."
PRE_german_youth_league:0"Establish the Prussian Youth League"
PRE_german_youth_league_desc:0"It is always crucial to influence the youth, for the future of the Prussian nation is in their hands alone. As such, it is vital for us to expand on our Volkist and nationalist curriculum, to merge the many different rightwing youth movements in Prussia into one Prussian Youth League, with mandatory enrollment for Aryan children and direct control by the state. Only by these means will the youth be ensured to learn the values appropriate for a nation of soldiers and heroes."
PRE_new_german_nationalism:0"Neue Deutsche Nationalismus"
PRE_new_german_nationalism_desc:0"It is increasinly clear that Goring's intense mix of constant propaganda, firm education of the youth, enthusiastic marches and rallies, and bombastic rhetoric has truly re-energised the Prussian people. Increasingly, the bellicose nationalism that lies at the core of the AdNP's ethos is being accepeted as a universal truth by the people, and true dedication to the German race is increasingly evident among the public. All is going as Goring has long dreamed, and the future is surely bright."
PRE_reichswerke:0"Reichswerke Hermann Goring"
PRE_reichswerke_desc:0"If we are to be truly ready for the glorious wars and struggles that will forever settle the fate of the fatherland, we have no choice but to strenghten the economy, by any means necessary. As such, Goring has resolved to extend state control over the Prussian economy, establishing a new industrial and mining conglomerate, the Reichswerke Hermann Goring, which will be able to break the financial influence of wealthy industrialists, and greatly enhance production."
PRE_deutsche_arbeiters_front:0"Deutsche Arbeiters Front"
PRE_deutsche_arbeiters_front_desc:0"Although the existing crypto-Marxist trade unions, already greatly suppressed by the Junkers, must never be allowed to re-emerge, the principle of worker representation is not one we should lose sight of; after all, the worker is a true, common German, unlike any cosmpolitan and wealthy boss. As such, all current trade unions should be rolled up into one united German Workers' Front, under direct supervision by the government, and able to ensure the just treatment of workers while also promoting a message in line with Goring's nationalism."
PRE_forced_industrialization:0"Forced Industrialisation"
PRE_forced_industrialization_desc:0"We can waste not time in the need to save Prussia's economy and ready it for war. No further obstruction to the industrialisation of the nation, whether by greedy bosses or by seditious Marxists, can be tolerated. The state, under Chancellor Goring, will assume direct control over industrial building projects and the construction of industrial plants. Only thus can we ensure that the economy is sufficiently strenghtened for the coming era-defining struggle."
PRE_prussian_steel:0"The Steel of Silesia"
PRE_prussian_steel_desc:0"Few areas of Europe are as ric in steel as our southern regions of Silesia, a rere blessing that we can ignore no longer. By further extending state involvment in the steel mills, and hence greatly increasing our investements in the resources, we will be able to find valuable new materials with which to fuel the war machine of tomorrow, besides to trade around the world, legitmising our government and greatly strenghtening the economy."
PRE_expand_coal_mines:0"Expand the Coal Mines"
PRE_expand_coal_mines_desc:0"Mining has long been a vital aspect of the Prussian economy, and with the world rapidly hurtling towards war, we shall need a great deal of it. As such, we must redouble our efforts to enhance coal mining around the country, and assume direct control over the industry from the free market. Only under the guidance of the state and the Chancellor can the mining industry be saved and used for the glory of the nation, and so shall it be."
PRE_arbeit_macht_frei:0"Arbeit Macht Frei"
PRE_arbeit_macht_frei_desc:0"The economy will never have grown enough, but we are starting to run out of... conventional ways to fuel it. As such, it is now being urged by many members of the government that we greatly expand the detention of political opponenents and other enemies of the aryan race, introdusing a much increased degree of forced labour to the treatment od detainees. Whatever some outdated moralists say, this necessary step is both a just punishment for crimes against the German nation, and will make the economy soar!"
PRE_ministry_of_propaganda:0"The Magic of Propaganda"
PRE_ministry_of_propaganda_desc:0"If there is one thing we must do, it is reach the hearts and minds of the people. And the Rhenish-born fanatic nationalist and staunch supporter of Goring, Hans Fritzsche, has all the right ideas. Long a senior figure in the AdNP, Fritzsche will now be empowered as Minister for Porpoaganda, and Goring intends to give this likely genius access to a number of innovative ways of shaping the people's thinking."
PRE_establish_schutzstaffel:0"Empower the Blueshirts"
PRE_establish_schutzstaffel_desc:0"Goring's loyal followers in the blueshirt paramilitary have long fought for all that is right in the German spirit, bravely holding the line against degenerate liberals and dated reactionaries alike. What's more, they have learnt vital skills and tactics during the long years of street fighting that may be invaluable for future occupations As such, it is crucial for Goring to empower them and their respected leader, Horst Wessel, to maintain order across the nation, and continue the fight for the German race."
PRE_loyal_sons_of_germania:0"Loyal Sons Of Germania"
PRE_loyal_sons_of_germania_desc:0"No virtue is greater than total loyalty, total devotion, to the race and to the cause. It is, of course, vital for every good Prussian to know this truth, and the radio stations, the newspapers, the rallies, will never stop reinforcing this most heroic and crucial of messages until the whole population knows it as true. All for Germany, and Germany for all!"
PRE_meine_ehre:0"Glorify Prussian Discipline"
PRE_meine_ehre_desc:0"Historically crucial to Prussian culuture and identity is the eternal principle of unfaluterinfg discipline: unbroken courage in war, devotion to orders, and the subordination of one's own feeble interests for the greatness of the nation and the state. It is essential that eveery Aryan Prussian knows and accepts this to be the rock on which the Reich is to be built, and never wavers in their heroic devotion to this most glorious of values."
PRE_armaments_miracle:0 "Armaments Miracle"
PRE_armaments_miracle_desc:0"With our extensive economic reforms now beginning to greatly pay off, many are commenting that nothing short of a mircale is taking place in the armaments industry. What was, mere ears ago, an ecnomically depressed agrarian backwater, is now one of the greatest industrial centres of Europe, churning out guns, planes, and tanks fater than ever, and  fuelling what seems to be an unstoppable war machine. With such industrial might behind us, we truly are destined to be masters of Europe!"
PRE_rebirth_of_a_nation:0"The New Bismarck"
PRE_rebirth_of_a_nation_desc:0"Goring's total consolidation of power, overwhelming reawakening of the Prussian nation, and unparrallelled achiements, can leave us with only one conclusion. This excellent and valiant man, who has dedicated his entire life to the German nation and race, is nothing short of a true successor to Otto von Bismarck, father of the German nation. It is time to reveal this glorious truth to the people, doubtless further swelling the extensive and well-deserved cult of Chancellor Goring."

PRE_the_eagle_rises_desc:0"At long last, after all the blood, toil, tears, and sweat, after all the chaos, all the pain, all the struggle, the Prussian eagle has finally risen, soaring triumphantly over Europe and over the world. Led exceptionally by Chancellor Goring, and indeed by His Majesty August Wilhelm, our glorious Reich shall last for a thousand years to come. Nothing can stop us now!"
#events
pre.1.t:0 "Preußen Erwache"
pre.1.d:0 "In the aftermath of the collapse of the Paris Peace Conference and the French occupation of the west bank of the Rhine, the failure to defend the Rhineland from an invasion that blatantly violated the Armistice was the last nail in the coffin for the already impoverished and chaotic republic, and Ebert didn't bother resisting when reactionary Junkers, with the backing of the Army and Freikorps, marched into Berlin, creating a new regime under the rightist beureaucrat Wolfgang Kapp. However, the putschists were hated by much of the population and lacked the resources to consolidate power across the country, and leftist uprisings broke out in much of Germany, cutting off the main Putschist forces in Prussia. In spite of this, separate Bavarian Freikorps units under Franz Ritter von Epp and Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, among others, were able to restore a reactionary government under the conservative Gustav Kahr, and this regime proceeded to aid rightists in the neighbouring states of Baden and Wurtemberg restore their own monarchies. Although the Prussian regime celebrated this, hoping that the rightists in Southern Germany would reuinte with them, Kahr, a strong regionalist, proclaimed an independent Bavarian state instead, while the socialists managed to secure their grip over the north-west, and local Freikorps units in Mecklenburg and Saxony also asserted their independence, and the Danes occupied the Kiel canal.\nLeft with only Prussia, a broken Kapp was forced to resign by the very same aristocrats and officers who had put him in power a matter of months. Since then, the subsequently proclaimed Prussian republic has seen its politics dominated by the Junkers and their allies, with many accusing the state of operating a mere sham democracy, with a succession of Chancellors all answering to and working with the same aristocratic cliques. However, the current Chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher, is known to be more blatantly authoritarian, militaristic, and pro-worker than the Junkers, alongside his reputation for political intrigues. In oposition to the Junker government are the reformists of the Nationale Liberale Partei, which was re-established by Prussian liberals after initially falling apart after the collapse of the German Empire. Despite their staunch support for democracy, they also take a determined Pan-Germanist stance, dreaming of the day when all Germans are united under one flag. Meanwhile, the Junkers' failure to either restore the Hohenzollern monarchy or make any effective moves to restore German pride has galvanised opposition on the right as well. Both Alfred Hugenberg's reactionary monarchist DNVP and the Alldeutsch Nationale Partei, formed by Herman von Goring after Kahr had him exiled from Bavaria for his pan-Germanism and extremism, are harsh critics of the status quo."

pre.2.t:0 "The Corruption Report"
pre.2.d:0 "For some time, corruption has been a rampant problem in the Prussian administration, and, to appease criticism from the opposition, Schleicher commissioned a report on corruption in the state in October od 1935. Today, the finished report reached Schleicher's desk, and, although we knew it would look bad, nobody was prepared for this.\nThe report implicates all but the etnirety of the Prussian  state, laying bare the shakey apparatus of manipulation and intimidation that has propelled the Junkers' favoured candidates to successive election victories, and exposing Schleicher's own unscrupulous methods.\n\Until we find a way to wrap this up in safer terms for the public, and resolve the countless disputes within the government that this will cause, we must hope that it can stay secret."
pre.2.a:0 "Let's keep this wrapped up..."

pre.3.t:0 "The Junkers' Ultimatum"
pre.3.d:0 "With the protests enveloping Berlin, a number of prominent Junkers today met with Kurt von Schleicher, demanding that he take responsibility for the corruption and step down, arguing that only this can preserve the republic. They are proposing that Schliecher make way for Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, a Junker conservative from Saxony, who found himself in Prussia amidst the chaos of 1919, and proceeded to build a significant career there. Initially a member of the DNVP, he broke with the party over Hugenberg's radicalism, making him a trustworthy candidate in the eyes of the Junkers.\n\However, Schleicher has been planning for some time to make his own move at consolidating power, forming a so-callled "Querfront" coalition of nationalist and pro-worker parties to oppose Goring and also free himself of Junker control, and also bypass the Junkers' power. Perhaps, this is his opportunity to do just that."

pre.4.d:0 "Elections in Prussia have, since the birth of the repbulic, all but guaranteed victories for the Junkers' favoured candidated, through he liberal use of manipulation and intimidation. Today, Oskar von indenburg, a prominent member of the Camarilla and son of the great Field Marshal, met with Goerdeler to outline his proposals to do much the same in the coming election, lest the radicals take advantage of the scandal to make significant gains. Although this would secure our ability to hold on to power and pursue our own goals, others fear that such a move will only spur on Goring and Hugenberg."

pre.5.t:0 "The Elections"
pre.5.d:0 "Today, the citizens of Prussia will go to the polls again, this time in an election notably free of the conventional rigging and manipulation. As such, many are expecting a shakeup in the results, and potentially an unprecedented victory for the opposition, although the people may still look to the Junkers for stability."

pre.7.d:0 "With Schleicher having refused to resign, and instead pinned the blame for the corruption on the Junkers themselves, Prussia's traditional elite are now furious, with Goerdeler demanding from the Reichstag that Schleicher make way, while the opposition siezes on the clear division in the government. Now, rumours are reaching Schleicher's office of a possible putsch by the Junkers and their allies, and many are urging him to act."
pre.7.a:0 "These are just rumours, we can't do anything drastic"
pre.7.b:0 "We have to crack down on the Junkers"

pre.8.t:0 "The Junkers' Putsch"
pre.8.d:0 "Today, our worst fears came to pass, and units of the Prussian army, commanded by Erwin von Witzleben, stormed Berlin. The surrounded Reichstag hastily voted for the formation of a new National Unity Government under Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, while Schleicher was forced to stand down in the Chancellory, before being led away to a secure prison, where he will await trial for corruption, and, potentially, treason. Meanwhile, a speech by Goerdeler to the nation over the radio has confirmed the largely peaceful siezure of power, and it is clear that the Junkers are safely back in control of Prussia."
pre.8.a:0 "So be it..."

pre.9.t:0 "Purging the Junkers"
pre.9.d:0 "Having resolved to crack down on the Junkers, we must now set about securing our position, and it is thus necessary to start purging the Junker cliques that have controlled the government for so long. As such, many are urging Schliecher to arrange the assasination of Goerdeler, to cut the Junker camarilla off from its most obvious figurehead. Others, meanwhile are urging that this doesn't go nearly far enough, and that with the Junkers now beginning to form an alliance of necesssisty with Goring and the AdNP, we may need to declare martial law outright."
pre.9.a:0 "Assasinate Goerdeler"
pre.9.b:0 "Declare Martial Law"

pre.10.t:0 "The Death of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler"
pre.10.d:0 "Today in Berlin, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was shot in the street from a passing car. He died very quickly, but his death has thrown Berlin into crisis, and it seems his assasination has had quite the opposite effect to that which we intended. Already, prominent Junkers are accusing us of having murdered him, and it is understood that the late Paul von Hindenburg's son, Oskar, a notable camarilla politician, has been meeting with Herman Goring, seeking to co-ordinate actions against Schleicher. The future of the government seems anything but secure."
pre.10.a:0 "Oh dear..."

pre.11.t:0 "The Purge Succeeds"
pre.11.d:0 "In the past days, countless notable Junkers, including every notable member of the old camarilla, have been rounded up and imprisoned by the police force, with Schleicher's hold on the country being greatly consolidated. With Goerdeler, Oskar von Hindeburg, and countless other Junker politicians safely behind bars, we need no longer worry about the threat posed by the aristicratic conservatvies, and can focus on negotiating a Querfront coalition."
pre.11.a:0 "Excllent"

pre.12.t:0 "The Coup"
pre.12.d:0 "Tiday, our worst fears came to pass, as uniformed supporters of Herman von Goring and the AdNP, alongside units of the army still loyal to the Junkers, commanded by Erwin von Witzleben, stormed Berlin. The soldiers forced their way into the Reichstag, where Oskar von Hindenburg promptly condemned the Schleicher regime as traitors to Prussia, and demanded an extra-legal motion to proclaim a new Government of National Unity and Salvation, representing both the Junkers and the AdNP.With the Chancellory surrounded, Schleicher himself surrendered 2 hours later, and was quietly taken to a secure prison, where he shall await trial for treason while his allies are unceremoniously disposed of.\nNow, Herman von Goring finds himself at last in control of Prussia, but his grip is nevertheless a fragile one, with the Junkers' influence strong as ever within the unity government. As such, we are now facing calls from the military and moderates in the Party to try to continue working with the Junkers, in the hope of better uniting the nation. Others, however, are urging that Goring should take the opportunity to further consolidate his own power, forcing the Junkers to submit."
pre.12.a:0 "We need to work together"
pre.12.b:0 "The Junkers' loyalty must be guaranteed"

pre.13.t:0 "Goring Outmaneuvered"
pre.13.d:0 "In the past days, in the absence of any effort from Goring and the AdNP to reign in the Junkers' influence, they have gradually re-exerted their power all across Prussia, disarming local branches of the AdNP and securing the grip of loyal military units over the nation's security. This came to a head today, when Oskar von Hindenburg announced to the Reichstag, seemingly without even consulting Goring, that the unity government had come to an end, and that Goring's term in office was over. With the Chancellory sounded by pro-Junker soldiers for the second time recently, Goring had little choice but to submit, and forlornly confirmed his resignation. Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag unanimously nominated von Hindeburg as the new Chancellor of Germany. Although recent months have been tough, decent governance has at last been restored to Germany."
pre.13.a:0 "Hurrah!"

pre.14.t:0 "The Day at Potsdam"
pre.14.d:0 "Over the past days, Goring has greatly moved to extend his own influence, at the expense of the Junkers. By replacing Junker-aligned military garrisons with AdNP militants, alongside replacing Junkers in local governments and stacking the cabinet with AdNP loyalists, Goring has gone some way towards consolidating power, and has clearly greatly intimidated the Junkers, who today agreed to meet with Goring and other AdNP leaders at Potsdam.\nAt this "Day at Potsdam", as it has been dubbed by the press, the Junkers were clearly forced to recognise that their ability to continue their own government over Prussia is over, and that they have little choice but to co-operate with Goring, in exchange for very limited concessions in the countryside and agriculture. The message is clear: Prussia has one leader, and that man is Herman von Goring."
pre.14.a:0 "Heil Goring!"

pre.15.t:0 "The Negotiations Reach an Impasse"
pre.15.d:0 "Over the past days, we have been negotiating with numerous lefist and nationalist movements, from the remnants of the Social Democras to Oskar Niekisch's discontented leftwing of the AdNP, to try to form a new Querfront coalition in the Reichstag, able to support Schleicher against Goring and the Junkers and allowing Schleicher to bypass the Junkers in governnance, finally breaking their grip over power.\nHowever, the negotiations have reached a clear impasse, with the disparate factions that Schleicher seeks to incroporate struglling to find much common ground, and increasingly bickering rather than bothering to try. As such, some aides are now urging Schleicher to use some few carefully-placed threats and intimidation to force the parties into co-operation, although others argue that they'll soon sort themselves out."
pre.15.a:0 "They'll get their act together, given time"
pre.15.b:0 "We need to ensure their collaboration, whatever it takes"

pre.16.t:0 "The Negotiations Collapse"
pre.16.d:0 "Today, with the different factions Schleicher had hoped to unite unable to find sufficient common ground, and the previous deadlock having failed to be resolved, the representatives of the various parties unceremoniously walked out of the talks. What remains of the Junkers' political influence has by now been subsumed by the AdNP, with the aristocrats seeing Goring as a better alternative to the "crypto-socialist" Schleicher. Meanwhile, our chances of gaining any support among leftist or centrist movements have come to nothing. Whatever is next in store for Prussia, Schleicher's days are clearly numbered..."
pre.16.a:0 "Scheisse!"

pre.17.t:0 "The Negotiations Succeed"
pre.17.d:0 "Today, in the aftermath of some liberal use of intimidation by Schleicher's allies in the Abwehr, the various parties that he had been seeking to unite into a Querfront against the nationalists and Junkers finally agreed to formalise their coalition in the Reichstag, forming the new government of the Republic of Prussia. With a newfound loyal majority in the Reichstag, Schleicher now has a free hand to pursue his policies, and it won't be long before Hugenburg, Goring, and the reactionary aristocrats are gone for good."
pre.17.a:0 "Hurrah!"

pre.18.t:0 "Schleicher Addresses the Reichstag"
pre.18.d:0 "Today, President Kurt von Schleicher spoke to the assembled Reichstag, inaugurating its annual session. Promising the Prussian people new rural investments and "a calm, repsonsible government, as suits our nation", it was widely believed that Schleicher's speech was mostly written by Junker aides, representing the reactionary aristocrats who have all but controlled successive Prussian governments, and see Schleicher's as no different: something that he is understood to be deeply dissatsifed with. Nonetheless, the speech was broadly well reicived, drawing reluctant applause even from the hardline nationalist and reformist liberals present, and praised by the press. Surely, if there's one thing we can count on, it's a stable political scene."
pre.18.a:0 "Very well"

pre.19.t:0 "Attacking the AdNP"
pre.19.d:0 "For years, Prussia's various governments have, behind the facade of democracy, employed a signifcant amount of manipulation and intimidation to keep the opposition firmly out of power, and now is no different. With Herman Goring's Alldeutsche Nationale Partei rapidly gaining traction among disillusioned nationalists and young army officers, Schleicher's allies in the Abwehr have come to us with a new proposal to undermine these dangerous extremists.\nThe national bolshevik theorist Ernst Niekisch played a crucial role in the founding of the party, seeing the Prussian ethos of the more conventional nationalist Goring as a shift in the right direction towards a nationalist and socialist Germany. Predictably, his left wing of the party has come into much conflict with the party's aristocratic and corporatist mainstream. As such, the Abwehr is suggesting that we meet in secret with Niekisch's allies, to sow greater dissatisfaction with Goring among the AdNP's left wing. Nonetheless, many Junkers are concerned that in strenghtening Niekisch we may simply create another powerful opposition movement that will cause probelms for us later on."
pre.19.a:0 "It's not worth the effort"
pre.19.b:0 "Go ahead"

pre.20.t:0 "The Report Leaks"
pre.20.d:0 "Today, our worst fears have come to pass. The corruption report, in all its horrendous detail, was published on the front page of Die Gartenlaube, Alfred Hugenberg's flagship newspaper. The country has already been thrown into chaos, with the opposition, whether royalist, nationalist, or liberal, all pouring out into the streets, demanding not just Schleicher's resignation but the outright end of Junker rule in Prussia. Goring's blueshirt paramilitaries and liberal deputies alike are now baying for our blood. Although we may never know who leaked the report, it is safe to say that that man has done more damage to our government than any other sincw 1919. While we scramble to find a response to the chaos, one this is certain: Prussia will never be the same again"
pre.20.a:0 "How did we let this happen?"

pre.21.t:0 "The Goring Putsch"
pre.21.d:0 "Today, with the Querfront talks having collapsed, and Niekisch's now humiliated left-AdNP having turned back in humiliation to Goring, Schleicher finally fell. Military units, working in close co-ordination with Goring's blueshirts, siezed vital administrative and media buldings across Berlin, while outside of the capital local garrisons and blueshirt groupings were able to assume control of the local administrations.\nAt 1PM, the Reichstag almost unanimously passed a hastily prepared bill granting "supreme and unrestrained power" to Herman Goring, as Prussia's sole and unchallenged leader. The few deputies that had voted against this bill were promptly rounded up by the soldiers who had forced their way into the chamber, and have since been charged with high treason.\nTwo hours later, with the Chancellory surrounded and all hope lost, Schleicher finally surrendered, and was led out of the building by a tightly-knit group of soldiers, while hundreds of blueshirts gathered in the street chaotically demanded his execution on the spot. Although the military men's proffesionalism won out, and the lynch mob achieved little, his days are doubtless numbered.\nNow, however, Goring alone stands at the helm of the Prussian nation, and God alone knows what lies next..."
pre.21.a:0 "Heil Goring!"

pre.22.t:0 "The Talks Begin"
pre.22.d:0 "Today in Berlin, Kurt von Schleicher formally opened talks between a number of different political groups to form a new Querfront coalition against the Junkers and fanatic nationalists. Present at the negotiations were the national-bolshevik philosopher Ernst Niekisch, who, despite having co-founded the AdNP with Goring, has become increasinly estranged from the party's mainstream, the social democrat Otto Braun, who was able to rally the remnants of Prussia's SPD in the 1920s and rebuild its political machine after the rightist putsch of 1919, and representatives of many smaller nationalist organisations which have become increasinly estranged from Goring, most notably Franz Seldte's Stalhelm veterans' group and paramilitary.\nIt can't be denied that the coalition Schleicher is trying to build is an extraordinarily big tent, but the Chancellor is nonetheles hopeful. After all, there is no other way he could hold on to power."
pre.22.a:0 "We'll need a lot of luck to pull this off..."

pre.23.t:0 "The Enabling Act is Passed"
pre.23.d:0 "Today in the Reichstag, a body already informally stripped of much of its power through extensive arrests and intimidation, Goring's extreme amounts of power were further formalised. The prominent Reichstag deputy and leader of Goring's blueshirts, Hosrt Wessel, introduced a new motion - the Enabling Act. This law, adopted all but unanimously a short time later, gives Goring overwhelming executive power to alter the constitution and stamp out opposition groups at will. From now on, the law of Prussia is Goring's will. Nothing more, and nothing less."
pre.23.a:0 "Heil Goring!"

pre.24.t:0 "The Restoration of the Kingdom of Prussia"
pre.24.d:0 "Today, at a vast rally in Konigsberg, Hermann Goring made a sudden and unprecedented announcement. The Kingdom of Prussia, having collapsed in 1918 with Wilhelm II's abdication, was to be restored effective-immediately, with Goring declared its Regent. Notably present at the rally was August Wilhelm von Hohenzollern, a younger son of the old Kaiser and a longstanding supporter of the AdNP. Given his increasingly close relationship with the Goring government, many are now starting to believe that "little Auwi", as he has been mockingly dubbed by the press, may in fact become King."
pre.24.a:0 "Heil Goring!"

pre.25.t:0 "The Coronation"
pre.25.d:0 "Today, in a lavish ceremony in Berlin, August Wilhelm von Hohenzollern was crowned as King of Prussia. With the historic Hohenzollern crown placed upon his head by the Lutheran bishop in front of a vast audience, and Goring as his chancellor only a short distance away, it was clear to all that the old Kingdom had indeed been restored, but under a very different government to that which had ruled the Empire prior to 1918 - and, indeed, one that isn't going anywhere. Nonetheless, the historic coronation has generated widespread enthusiasm, and has done much to legitimise Goring's rule."
pre.25.a:0 "A glorious day!"

pre.26.t:0 "Nationwide Pogroms"
pre.26.d:0 "Across the country, patriotic citizens, spurred on by local units of blueshirts and by the rhetoric of Goring and his propagandist Hans Fritzsche, are taking action like never before against Jewish influence. Over the past days, Jewish-owned shops and businesses have been attacked, looted, or even outright repossesed by the mobs, and many Jewish citizens have been attacked in the street. This violence is earning us musch condemnation around the world, something hardly helped by our continued endorsement of both the ideals and methods of the  mobs, but it is nonetheless needed in order to free Prussia from the shackles of Jewish influence and global finance."
pre.26.a:0 "If only people stood up for themselves like this more often..."

pre.27.t:0 "Changes at the Abwehr"
pre.27.d:0 "Over the past days, notable changes have been underway at the national intelligence agency, the Abwehr, something that has hardly gone unnoticed by the public. The agency's old guard, dominated by such figures as Hans Oster and Hans Bernd Gisevius, which gained its influence under Junker rule and was closely aligned with the Schleicher government, has been purged almost in its entirety, with hundreds of officials unceremoniously removed from office. Their replacements, mainly old blueshirt officers, have been tirelessly combing through file after file, gathering prodigious levels of intelligence for the new government. Few are certain what exactly this turn of events signifies, but it's clear that something big is around the corner..."
pre.27.a:0 "Just you wait and see..."

pre.28.t:0 "The Night of the Long Knives"
pre.28.d:0 "As the Prussian nation woke up this morning, they were confronted with an astonishing reality, far beyond anything that even the most pessimistic anti-nationalists could have dreamed of. Hundreds of opponents of the regime, from socialists to reactionary aristocrats, were murdered last night in one fell sweeop. Ernst Niekisch, the national-bolshevik co-founder of the AdNP, who increasingly diverged from Goring, was riddled with bullets in the middle of the street. Otto Braun, leader of the Prussian SPD, was hung in his own home. Wilhelm Kulz, the veteran centrist, was found mutilated in a ditch outside Berlin. Hundreds more met similar fates, and from now on nobody will so much as dare to speak a bad word about the Chancellor or King. Goring's rule was always absolute, but from this point onwards it will be unchallenged entirely. Only a bloodbath such as this could have liberated the nation."
pre.28.a:0 "You get what you fucking deserve!"

pre.29.t:0 "A Meeting with Oster"
pre.29.d:0 "Although Schleicher has managed to consolidate his power in the short term, with the aid of Braun and Niekisch among others, much work still needs to be done for the political situation to be stabilised: a task for which we'll need a great many allies. With this in mind, Chancellor von Schleicher today met with the Abwehr administrator Hans Oster, a longstanding supporter of many of Schleicher's ideas, and opponent of Goring. Although what exactly the two discussed will likely remain unclear forever, it is clear that from here on out the Abwehr, already a vital ally of Schleicher, will play a crucial role in his government, and that it may begin to put its vast resources towards aiding him in what remains of his consolidation of power."
pre.29.a:0 "Excellent!"

pre.30.t:0 "Preparing for the Speech"
pre.30.d:0 "Kurt von Schleicher is now preparing to address the Reichstag for the second time in recent motnhs, but so much has changed since his last speech. The Junkers have fallen from grace spectacularly, and Schleicher himself has gone from little more than their puppet to an increasingly powerful military dictator, backed by everyone from social democrats to national bolsheviks. However, the broad range of groups that support the Schleicher government is increasingly confusing to much of the public, and many of Schleicher's aides are suggesting that, in his forthcoming speech, he should seek to clarify the principles and ideological stance of the Querfront government.\nThe problem with this, however, is that it is hard to say what that is. As such, different prominent figures in the Querfront have come forward with very different proposals. The national-bolshevik Ernst Niekisch is urging Schleicher to declare the new state to be "in principle and reality both socialist, and socialist, for such is the ethos of the eternal Prussian nation". On the other hand, the veteran social democrat Otto Braun is calling on Schleicher to state that "although democracy has always been at the heart of our republic, that democracy can for the time being no longer persist, if the state can have the strength to truly help its people". More conventional nationalists under Franz Seldte, on the other hand, want Schleicher to announce that "the state of Prussia will always be a conservative one, and our reforms are vital if anything is to be conserved at all".\nThe three different suggestions give radically different impressions of the nature of Schleicher's government, but it is clear that we'll have to side with one of them, if we are to bring some clarity to the purpose of our regime."
pre.30.a:0 "Niekisch makes the strongest point"
pre.30.b:0 "Braun's suggestions are best"
pre.30.c:0 "Side with Seldte on this one"

pre.31.t:0 "The DNVP and the Querfront"
pre.31.d:0 "Although Alfred Hugenberg's DNVP has not been invited to the Querfront talks, a great deal of activity has been taking place at their central offices over the last few days. It is clear that, although not everything about the coalition fills Hugenberg with enthusiasm, he may be coming to view it as preferable to the rule of Goring, or a revived Junker government. The inclusion of his paramilitary allies, the Stalhelm, in the talks has likely also gone some way to making the Querfront attractive to him. However, Hugenberg knows that Schleicher's position is still anything but secure, and is hesitant to become too committed, lest the tide turn yet again. For now, it seems, he intends to watch and wait, and see where the future leads."
pre.31.a:0 "Interesting"

pre.32.t:0 "The DNVP joins the Querfront"
pre.32.d:0 "With Schleicher having stabilised his government, and now rapidly consolidating his power, Alfred Hugenberg, leader of the DNVP, has reached a clear conclusion. His party's future, he has decided, is much better served within the new government thn outside it, where it would likely be outlawed and crushed. As such, he has agreed with Kurt von Schleicher, with Franz Seldte mediating between the two, that the DNVP will be incorporated into the Querfront coalition, and will from now on support the Schleicher government."
pre.32.a:0 "Excellent!"

pre.33.t:0 "A Rainy Night in Konigsberg"
pre.33.d:0 "Hermann Goring trudged along through the wet street, his soaked overcoat shielding the blue uniform beneath. The old airman was tired, and stressed: Schleicher was only getting more powerful, and by now Goring had to watch his back. But he walked on, for there was vital business to be done.\nDuring the earlier days of the crisis, countless coups against Schleicher had been discussed and planned, only to be called off later on. This time, however, would be different. Countless extremely influential businessmen, aristocrats, generals, had all been pushed over the line by the madness and radicalism of the Schleicher regime. They knew that drastic action had to be taken to liberate Prussia from this traitorous cyptosocialist, and they knew that Goring was the man for the job.\nGoring reached the building - an impressive one, surely a good sign of the power of the people who had reached out to him. He made his way in, and was greeted with obvious enthusiasm by a neatly-uniformed doorman, who relieved him of his coat and led him onwards to an impressive door, behind which, of course, would be the men who had approached him. Goring walked forwards, turned the handle, and made his way in.\nBut there was only one man in that room. One man, pointing a gleaming pistol right ahead."
pre.33.a:0 "So long, Hermann"
