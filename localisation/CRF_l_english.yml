crf.1.t:0 "The Demon King"
crf.1.d:0 "The young man ran through the twisting grey hallways of the newly occupied government bunker that had been seized by the forces of the One Million Demons led by their venerable Demon King. His name was rarely spoken, and those who would find themselves slipping up on that issue would also find themselves missing a body part they most likely would have kept on their person. As the young man continued to ran he passed by the doctor's quarters, the place where many an eye or tongue was removed on the order of the Demon King. It was said to be staffed by a white man, but whatever he had done to be there or deserve his fate as doctor for the Demon army was none of the young man's business, after all he was in quite the hurry. He had been stationed at one of the scout posts that were hidden around the bunker site's rims, and he had spotted an advancing force of Qing forces around a mile or two away from his small underground hovel that was used to scout and ambush when possible. The young man himself wore a unique uniform, it was the Nationalist Army uniform dyed jet black, with a poorly crafted wooden mask of a Yaoguai and a thin patrol cap that had not actually been dyed yet, and so retained its former dark blue coloring. Despite the man's youth, his equipment was of a vastly better quality then the men around him, a sign of his favor and the "elite" nature of the Demon Scouts. Finally after a few more minutes of running around nearly empty hallways, as the units had been deployed to an operation earlier that day and only the garrison remained, the young man came up to the door of the Demon King. On the steel bunker door read the words "Any who come in here without good reason shall be damned by the power of the Demon King.", the man hoped that a possible impending attack was good enough to qualify as a good reason. He burst through the door into the room and saw one man standing in front of a large map of the surrounding area and a statue of one of the Chinese gods of Luck, defaced and scarred by what looked like bullets. The man wore a similar uniform to the young man, a Nationalist Army uniform that had been died black with a demon mask, although the mask was of much higher quality and was properly painted and laminated. The imposing figure turned himself and looked back at the young man, his sharp brown eyes gleeming from behind the mask. The young man blurted out what he could, telling of an impending attack and the Qing patrol. The man in the mask simply came up to the young man and patted him on the back, calming and comforting him, and told him only one thing. "

crf.2.t:0 "Fire my Sweet"
crf.2.d:0 "Fire is the most honest and just thing there is in this rather wretched world, it, like death, does not discriminate in its consumption. Fire will burn you no matter your class and no matter your faith, it just consumes all that is organic around it, because it is true that it is fire that is the most just and holy. Orders from the Demon King have stated it simply, to do what is most just and holy we must consume that which is not holy with what is, and so we must burn the lands of our enemies. The bodies which splay themselves in front of their farms in terror are simply obstacles in divine justice, and they will be turned into crispy reminders of that fact if they dare come in the path of us, the demons. Fire is something that must be cultivated and loved, it is something that is a living thing and a fellow being that must be respected and understood if we, the demons of China, wish to ever come close to our namesake. We shall burn it all, burn all the lands our hands come in contact with, leaving only which land is useful to us virgin to the breathless agony of flames and our righteous pain. Now we understand that flames should not be used wildly and without responsibility, we must keep our bodies whole for the Demon King if we are going to win this war after all. So we have formed units which specialize in the application of fire and its use. These men have a great honor, for they are bestowed upon them with a large tank of gas, which is then piped and ignited by a simply lighter system, for many of these holy blowers of fire are handmade by the subjects of the Demon King. It is by this homemade nature that the fire Demons often burst into flames in a spectacular explosion, almost always on accident of course, which can put a dent in the manpower of the great Demon King. So as a response often only our youngest and most expendable soldiers are used, but in the end they are serving a purpose of holy and just fire that they may yet not understand at their young age. Once their spirit reaches adulthood, they could properly understand, and our Shamans and Priests have made sure to bless each exploded fire Demon who has died destroying the landscape of the enemy and transforming China into a more just land, resembling hell."

crf.3.t:0 "The Choice"
crf.3.d:0 "The Great Demon King has laid out his options on who he wishes to become his second in command, his master of spirits and souls, his general of demonkind. There are two men, both of whom have felt the tinges of hell on their asses and have come out of it with perspectives that match their monstrous exterior. The Demon General, his name having once been Zeng Kuoqing, is on one side of the isle. He has been constantly loyal to the Demon King and his will since the beginning, being a former General within the Army of the Republic of China, over time he had found Chiang to be too cowardly to be a proper leader. The moment that the Demon King had fled to the North to make his One Million Demons, the Demon General had followed him and been at his side. On the issue of personality he is bland, unoffensive, and entirely boring, all things that have made the Demon King seek any other possible choice. The Demon Doctor has been the other choice, a man with an unusual story that has been left in the past when it comes to the Demons. Some say that he is a white man from the west, while others say that is merely a ruse, and in reality he is the avatar of Pien Chueh or some Demon of Pain. Whatever he is, he is not simply unassuming or bland. The Doctor has been through agony, sheer agony, and his face is hidden behind a mask to make sure that no man would see him merely as a deformity or an abnormality. The Doctor seeks to heal China, he seeks progress and he seeks life, yet in his pursuit of life he has been driven mad by torture and the horrors of the Demon Army. So now the healer seeks to help the dealers of death kill so that he may have some form of peace. Regardless of all of that, the Demon King found him more interesting, which in reality was the only reason he had actually considered him in the first place. Both of the men had their benefits, the General would bring a relative stability to the Demon Army, something that the Demon King had been having difficulties with. As expected keeping an army of the uneducated, mentally ill, and rowdy tended to result in poor discipline and organization. The Doctor instead seeks to make the men masters of pain, and be able to take incredible punishment and then deal it our in equal spades. Either way, the Demon King made his choice..."
