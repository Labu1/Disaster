crf.1.t:0 "The Demon King"
crf.1.d:0 "The young man ran through the twisting grey hallways of the newly occupied government bunker that had been seized by the forces of the One Million Demons led by their venerable Demon King. His name was rarely spoken, and those who would find themselves slipping up on that issue would also find themselves missing a body part they most likely would have kept on their person. As the young man continued to ran he passed by the doctor's quarters, the place where many an eye or tongue was removed on the order of the Demon King. It was said to be staffed by a white man, but whatever he had done to be there or deserve his fate as doctor for the Demon army was none of the young man's business, after all he was in quite the hurry. He had been stationed at one of the scout posts that were hidden around the bunker site's rims, and he had spotted an advancing force of Qing forces around a mile or two away from his small underground hovel that was used to scout and ambush when possible. The young man himself wore a unique uniform, it was the Nationalist Army uniform dyed jet black, with a poorly crafted wooden mask of a Yaoguai and a thin patrol cap that had not actually been dyed yet, and so retained its former dark blue coloring. Despite the man's youth, his equipment was of a vastly better quality then the men around him, a sign of his favor and the "elite" nature of the Demon Scouts. Finally after a few more minutes of running around nearly empty hallways, as the units had been deployed to an operation earlier that day and only the garrison remained, the young man came up to the door of the Demon King. On the steel bunker door read the words "Any who come in here without good reason shall be damned by the power of the Demon King.", the man hoped that a possible impending attack was good enough to qualify as a good reason. He burst through the door into the room and saw one man standing in front of a large map of the surrounding area and a statue of one of the Chinese gods of Luck, defaced and scarred by what looked like bullets. The man wore a similar uniform to the young man, a Nationalist Army uniform that had been died black with a demon mask, although the mask was of much higher quality and was properly painted and laminated. The imposing figure turned himself and looked back at the young man, his sharp brown eyes gleeming from behind the mask. The young man blurted out what he could, telling of an impending attack and the Qing patrol. The man in the mask simply came up to the young man and patted him on the back, calming and comforting him, and told him only one thing. "
