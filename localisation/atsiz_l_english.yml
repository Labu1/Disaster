 #events
 atsiz.10.t:0 "The Nzdeh Uprising"
 atsiz.10.d:0 "Today, the filthy Armenians have risen up against our rule. What originally started out as a series of small uprisings here and there has finally turned into a full on rebellion against our state. The Armenians, led by Garegin Nzhdeh, have proclaimed that they will "put an end to the oppression of their people and to Turkish tyranny". Of course, their rule shall be short lived and we will conquer them and bring them back into the fold in no time."
 atsiz.10.a:0 "CHARGE!"

 atsiz.1.t:0 "The New Order"
 atsiz.1.d:0 "Our great leader has begun to ensure that his rule shall remain unquestioned in all of Turkey, with one of his first actions in ensuring so being the banning of every political party within the nation, and in their place installing his own political movement, led by his loyalists and most trusted associates, who will be sure to bring Turkey up, where the former political parties had brought it down."
 atsiz.1.a:0 "Nation and Power."

 atsiz.2.t:0 "The Conquerers of The East"
 atsiz.2.d:0 "The Russians, oh the Russians. They constantly go on and on, droning about how they're Slavs, but in reality, we know the truth. The Russians are actually Turks and their Slavic identity is just another subset of the Turkic identity. They share the same origin as us, in the Central Asian steppe, and because of that they are our fellow brothers. We we shall make them see that, whether it is by means of peace or by force."
 atsiz.2.a:0 "Onwards!"

 atsiz.3.t:0 "The Conquerers of The West"
 atsiz.3.d:0 "In the heartland of Europe, away from Asia, lie yet another group of Turks, the Germanics. They have been fooled into believing that they are unrelated to us, when in reality they are as Turkic as can be. The Huns, as well as all the other ancient Germanic tribes were all originally tribes of Turks, who conquered their way into Europe. Whether or not the modern day descendants of the Germanics see things our way doesn't matter, because you cannot change the truth, and the truth is that they are Turks."
 atsiz.3.a:0 "Onwards!"

 atsiz.4.t:0 "The Subutais"
 atsiz.4.d:0 "To secure the reign of The New Order, we will create a militant organization called the Subutais and later on will integrate them into the re-organized army."
 atsiz.4.a:0 "Onwards!" 

 atsiz.6.t:0 "Armenian Discontent"
 atsiz.6.d:0 "It has came to our attention that the Armenian villages of the east are protesting our supposed Occupation and want withdrawal. Of course these protests were burned and destroyed, but we must be on foot to counter and insurrection."
 atsiz.6.a:0 "Worrying.."

 atsiz.7.t:0 "Battle of Yerevan"
 atsiz.7.d:0 "Our militants in Yerevan were harrased by the supposed Mountain Brigades but our soldiers have won even with high casulties. We will continue following the trails of the Armenians."
 atsiz.7.a:0 "Good."
