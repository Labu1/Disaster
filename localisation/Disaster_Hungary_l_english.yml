hungary.7.t:0"The Socialist Offensive"
hungary.7.d:0"As if we didn't have enough problems already, it seems that the recent political instability caused by our decision not to work with any of the major opposition groups has only grown worse. Various socialist and communist groups still somehow prevalent in Hungary, most still pledging loyalty to Kun's government, have organised in large groups in major cities, and have begun initiating protests and rallies. Though socialist agitation is not a new problem for us, this particular situation may prove to be much more dangerous. This presents us with essentially two choices: either we try to cut the head of the beast for good, and direct all required resources to destroying all socialists in Hungary, or we wait it out and hope that the protesters go away, just like they have in the past."
hungary.7.a:0"We can't take any risks. This ends now!"
hungary.7.b:0"Baah, we'll be fine..."

hungary.8.t:0"The Day Everything Became Nothing"
hungary.8.d:0"Just as it seemed that Horthy's regime will be governing Hungary for many more years, something unthinkable has happened. The socialist protests from the past weeks were only the beggining of a new future. A few days ago, seeing the right opportunity, communist veteran Bela Kun has returned from his exile in Austria, and immediately began preparing a coup. This was not a big problem for the mastermind organizer and revolutionary, and just a few hours before [GetDateText], pro-communist militias have seized the most vital points in Budapest on both banks of the river Danube.  A few moments later, Kun himself appeared in the Hungarian Parliament Building, and in a radio adress to the entire nation, declared the formal abolition of the monarchy and proclaimed the Second Hungarian Soviet Republic.\n\nIt looks like this time, it's here to stay."
hungary.8.a:0"Világ proletárjai, egyesüljetek!"
