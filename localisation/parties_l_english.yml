 national_bolshevik_subideology_desc:0 "Seeking to fuse extreme nationalism with Marxist economic policies, national bolshevism brings together the two most prominent radical movements of the 20th century, focusing its energies on the destruction of capitalism and liberal democracy. Whether or not their dream of a national workers' state truly can rise from the ruins of liberalism remains to be seen."
 strasserism_desc:0 "Influenced by the most extreme forms of both National Bolshevism and non-leftist nationalism, Otto Strasser has developed a new ideology, calling for total racial purity and fanatical nationalism within a communist economy."

Often socially conservative, nationalistiv, and economically right-wing, these governments hope to create the best future for their people, based on the wisdom of the past."
 reactionary_subideology_desc:0 "The conventional ideology of rightist authoritarians, Rectionary thought seeks to uphold society's culture and traditions through a strong and principled government. These regimes are, in practice, highly dictatorial, but vary on matters such as economics or foriegn policy, with some seeking isolationism and others bitterly revanchist, and some upholding the ideals of capitalism compared to others which desire a corporate state."
 ultranationalist_subideology_desc:0 "Moving on from older Reactionary thought, ultranationalist regimes seek to build a new state, one which encompasses and defends the whole national body. Generally religious, dictatorial, and corporatist, these governments put the nation first in all things and hope to defend it to the last."
 revolutionary_nationalist_subideology_desc:0 "Diverging from ordinary ultranationalism in its desire to revolutionise the nation and its contempt for established elites, Revolutionary Nationalists seek to sweep away all the trappings of liberalism and Marxism, often through extreme violence, and build a new, pure, national state."
 esoteric_traditionalist_subideology_desc:0 "Differing from other far-right ideologies in its hatred of establsihed religion, contempt for all modern corporate, capitalist, or marxist economics, and scorn for the 'modernist' nationalism that arose from the French Revolution, §CEsoteric Traditionalism§! desires to rebuild a medieval, localist, and often occultist, society, free from all modern culture and global economics."
 revolutionary_anarchist_subideology_desc:0 "Viewing the state itself as a tyranny incompatible with the basic rights of humanity, anarchism seeks to sweep it all away and build a new, truly free, world."

This ideals are criminalized in other Turkish nations in Anatolia, but one day, §R T H E Y  W I L L A L L P A Y F O R I T § "
 esoteric_islamism_subideology_desc:0 "Birthed from a date seed,§GAbdh'ülmajid'i Sharrriyat§! is an extremist evolution from the last Ottoman Caliphate which followed the school of Hanifa. §GAbdh'ülmajid'i Sharrriyat§! differs from regular Caliphates from history with it's centralization of Islam, with clerical entities such as Hodjas and Imaams not holding any power over the common Muslim. This new understanding of Allah's Words takes a look on the Tassavufi side, mostly inherited from Turkmen Muslims from 15th century, which focuses on the spirit of the Muslim man itself. The movement has also got inspired by §WJulius Evola§!'s hatred against consumerism and his esotericism"
