roc.1.t:0 "Red Star and the Blue Sun"
roc.1.d:0 "The profound victory of Doctor Sun Yat-sen over the Imperial Forces of China flew over like a wave, the people had finally won their freedom against the evil tyranny of the foreign forces of the Qing, and at last China held its head high, the Dragon once again towering in the east. Then after this fantastic victory and the first election in 1925, Sun Yat-sen, the Red General, the President promptly collapsed and died of cancer he had kept secret from everyone who had ever known him. The next day as his wife read his will, it was laid out that to avoid the right wing of the Kuomintang taking power in a election, he would instead run for office himself, knowingly dying soon into his reign but leaving the Left KMT leader Wang Jingwei as President. The right wing attempted an uprising against what they felt was a bastardization of democracy, but Wang managed to crush their forces and hold onto power. His regime saw the implementation of Georgian land reform, the nationalization and expansion of the rail system, a massive increase in literacy and education within the country, and a peaceful if slow development of the economy. But as the next election neared, Wang feared his popularity would not be sufficient, and so in a desperate bid sided himself with the Communist Party of China, who had united with the KMT in 1923 but then split after Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925. The Communists pushed the vote solidly in favor of Wang, with the 1929 elections having 63% of the vote going to the Left KMT and Communist coalition. The Communist-KMT alliance proved itself to be a resounding success despite the early ideological difficulties that plagued the first year of co-policy, as the Communist formed peasant communes that were largely self sufficient while Wang's government managed to develop the major cities that dotted the coast of China. Industry flourished as foreign investors flooded into the country, but were regulated by the strong guiding hand of the Wang regime. It is now 1936, the Communist-KMT alliance is at its height and the people are slowly but surely pushing China to becoming a power to rival Japan in strength. But there are whispers of discontent, the Right KMT has accused the government of rigging elections and mass repressions, and the Wang government has not been friendly to the Turkic peoples or their faith of Islam. Still, it for now seems as if nothing can go wrong."

roc.6.d:0 "Wang Jingwei had been celebrating the Chinese new year at his home in Beijing with many of his cabinet ministers and members of his party. He and several others went to the balcony to greet the citizens who were also celebrating the new year of the Rat. Wang and his friends, all very drunk, greeted the citizens with great kindness and joy. But what was about to unfold, was quite the contrast. As Wang and his posse went to head back into the home, they heard several gunshots, and then the sound of a gargantuan explosion, followed by many bloodcurdling screams. Wang quickly turned around and looked back, only to see that the streets in front of his home were now painted red with blood and gore. The carnage was simply astounding. He tried his best not to throw up, but the sickening scenes he had just seen convulsed in his mind and forced him to vomit.  The gunshots and explosions could still be heard, but they were now coming from afar. The air had a stench of guts and smoke from the guns and explosion. These attacks could only be traced back to one group: Dai Li, and his supporters. This was clear to Wang almost instantly. Wang ran up to his home's second floor patio to get a better view of the carnage, but that's when the second explosion occurred. The blast from it levelled Wang's home. Search teams spent all night looking for his body in the rubble, but to no success. It seems as though the year of the Rat has gone off to a terrible start..."

We are currently not aware if who has committed such an atrocity, but the good members of the Citizen's Police are combing the world for any information as to their whereabouts. If you have critical information on the assassins or any other tips, please visit your local Police Station for a reward on any information that could lead to the arrest of these terrorists. The Radio was switched off as 10 men sat alone in a smokey boardroom, their used cigarettes massing into a ever larger pile on what was presumably an ashtray a few days ago. After the death of President Wang, the remnants of the Chinese government that were not killed in the horrific explosion had grasped with no luck on what they could do against this total disaster. Wang had been the only thing keeping the Army, the Nationalists, and the Communists working together, and now he was dead, buried under a ton of sot and burnt wood. Chiang had tried to take power in the days following the coup, but the "Emergency Committee" as they were now called had flatly rejected these attempts. They had no illusions about the motivations Chiang truly held, he was a snake in the grass and probably was involved in Wang's death in the first place! But they had no leads, no way to try and consolidate a strong base or find a way to smoke the assassin out. These men of the Committee had only been what was left, with the highest among them being the Minister of Agriculture, the rest of the higher cabinet had also been blown up in the party that Wang had been throwing during the new year's celebrations. So the Chinese government stood at a standstill, waiting for a tip to leap upon."

The letter was opened, and within minutes that letter was being transcribed to the central police department, then the local government, then the Emergency Council. It was directions, very detailed directions at that, which indicated the exact position of one man named Dai Li, who in the letter was named as the head terrorist behind the New Years massacre as many had come to call it. It described his collaborators, his suppliers, and ever name one could possibly want, each and every one of them with instructions how to find them. The letter was simply marked, "A Friend", but it didn't matter who sent it, the exact thing the Emergency Council had been looking for had fallen in their lap, and they weren't about to look a gift horse in the mouth! In that smokey room the council partied in memory of Wang and for the fortune of the gods that had just shined upon them, I mean how lucky could they be? They just knew that there would be absolutely no backfiring of this whatsoever!"

roc.9.d:0 "The Shanghai radio faded in and out in the old bar that Jiang and his buddies hung out in, it was a stinky old hole in the wall where the paint was peeling and the beer was watery, but it was as close to home as any of these men had. They were all public workers, employed by one of the many state owned corporations set up by Wang during his tenure as president, and they were damn proud of it. Being a public worker meant Unionization, it meant better wages, and it meant they didn't have to work for some western bastard from London. Jiang and his friends were socialists, and due to their education they had been able to work in one of the public factories that were opening up around Shanghai. They had always been strong supporters of Wang's coalition as all the socialists had been, so when the shock of Wang's death hit them, Jiang could hardly stand up straight. The one half decent leader China had had for hundreds of years, and some demon thinks he can just knock him off and get away with it? Well he and his friends were listening in closely to the radio announcement, they had been tipped off through the grapevine that they had caught the Devil, the Soul Eater Dai Li, and were announcing his capture on the 6:00 PM news announcement. They huddled around, "Citizens of China, it is with our most glorious and proud words that we can say the demon Dai Li has been captured by our brave policemen and government forces a few days ago. He has been seen in a court and proclaimed guilty on all counts in a record two hours, and has been set to be hung next year. Let us all rejoice at the capture of the criminal and bandit who dared to harm our precious nation. This operation was coordinated by the General Chiang Kai-Shiek, who has consistently proclaimed sole responsibility for the capture of Dai Li to our reporters on the scene. As this crisis comes to a close, we must ask, who shall be the new president of China, and will the fragile coalition hold?"."

roc.10.t:0 "There goes the Neighborhood"
roc.10.d:0 "After the complete lack of a response by Chiang at the bombing of Chengdu, the communists, Mao especially, felt as if they could act with impunity towards their primarily current target, Shanghai. Despite the nominal Capital being within Beijing, the Nationalists had centred their power base within Shanghai and fortified the city into a castle for Chiang and his cronies. At least that is what the Nationalists had come to believe in their short time in power, they still continued to believe that they were untouchable despite all of the evidence pointing to the contrary. Socialist Partisans managed to neutralize the outer city guards by baiting them by dressing up as simple bandits and ambushing them, then taking their uniforms they took their place in the guard. Then, the gates free to the socialists, thousands of partisans were simply driven in by trucks while dressed as civilians. Taking their time, the partisans moved slowly into the administrative and military section of the city, eating in the shops that lined the streets and tacking in the sights to better blend in. Slowly, but surely, the partisans managed to meet up in the central region of the city, taking bombs and pistols they had hidden in their clothes and bags and getting to work. All at once, the partisans jumped into action, setting bombs on ever major building they could find as well as the military barracks, setting the mutual timers for roughly ten minutes. As the bombs were craft made their reliability was not stellar, but in five minutes the partisans had managed to plant all that they needed to and fled for their trucks. The police did happen to notice the bombs, but like in Chengdu it was far, far to late to be able to stop their detention. As central Shanghai exploded into a mass of warm tones, the partisans drove away back to their home in Sichuan, simply waiting for the order to be given and the revolution to begin. Needless to say the Crisis of Shanghai managed to further destroy the almost entirely destroyed reputation of Chiang's government, and many of his generals and governors are starting to ignore his direct orders, doing what they feel is best for their region of the country. Doom has come, a spiral of failure, and there was nothing the government could do but sit and watch and sip their tea."

roc.11.t:0 "Much Anarchy, Much Justice" 
roc.11.d:0 "It was a quiet day in Chengdu, well, as quiet as it can be when your country is on the brink of civil war and your province is the epicentre of all communist activity in the country. The buses still ran, the administrative offices did their work, the factories produced and chugged along. The day continue as it had for the last few years in the ancient city, but there was something odd in the air. Suddenly the police station got a report, there was a fire along the administrative district, building after building catching fire as the whole of the city rose from it's daily routine into a panic. Explosions could be heard from the decaying and poorly painted station as the entire skyline of half the city turned into a orange hued hell. Right as the Police department was about to send it's men out, a ticking could be heard from directly outside of the building, in the opposing passage leading into the alleyway. As the men of the police station investigated the sound, they found a single man, dressed in a industrial smock painted in a ugly mix of greys and oranges, fiddling around with a suitcase. The police asked for him to put his hands up, in which the mysterious man's response was to pull a pistol and clip one of the investigating officers in the shoulder, disappearing into a nearby alleyway. A few of the cops followed him, shouting and firing their guns, while the rest stayed behind to investigate the strange suitcase. As they did the ticking slowed down, it's cadence becoming slower and slower until it finally stopped. As the ticking stopped the police station and all of the police within found their bodies a neat paste on the nearby walls or crushed beneath the rubble of the building. Perhaps it would have been worth it to invest in bomb identification training, but it seems like that is moot by this point. The Socialists have finally organized to a point where an attack of this scale is viable, and the country teeters ever closer to total and utter war. Of course when Chiang heard the news, he believed that the fires and bombings had been the result of the incompetence of his own men rather then his policies feeding the ranks of these partisans. It seems like despite this shock, the Chinese government would not be responding in any true sense to the attack, this being exactly what Mao had been testing for."

roc.12.d:0 ""You have to actually be shitting me, there is no way in no universe under heaven that fucking Chiang could be appointed president by a council of fucking socialists!" Mao threw the newspaper across the hotel room, both him and Deng had agreed to meet there in dire situations that would require leaving their government posts in Beijing. Mao had been the master of records within Wang's government, a job he had taken too quite well since his early days as a library clerk, and he had been satisfied with his position. He had been a member of the Communist party nearly since it had been founded through his dedicated involvement in the New Culture movement, and had been one of the strongest proponents of Nationalist-Communist unity since the very beginning. His loyalty had won him friends and enemies, but he had managed to secure relatively high government office in his 30s thanks to that very loyalty, as well as some well written critiques of classical Chinese culture. The other man standing across from Mao couldn't be more different except for in his loyalty to his cause, Deng had been one of the members of the Communist Party who had supported a transitional economic period, believing that through rapid industrialization and the advancement of technology China could become a superpower. This view was unpopular with many, as it would sidestep the common farmer and instead bring a new industrial working class to bear. Deng had been appointed Assistant Minister of Economics despite his age, and many had claimed that China's policy under the last few years of Wang were directly influenced by his ideas. Both of these men stood across from each other in a dirty Hotel room, and both knew the struggle that was coming to greet them in the future. The bastard Chiang had taken power, and with him the coalition had collapsed and the Communists and Socialists expelled from the government all but officially.Unlike many of their other comrades however, these two had a plan."

Any symbol or icon that could remotely be seen as socialistic was destroyed, all left wing books were burnt, all of this while the police stood by and could do nothing to help. Some police of course did try to protect what they could, such as Officer Yuan Lee, who tried to fight off two members of the Blue Shirts from burning down a coffee shop in Beijing that had used a red star in its logo. He managed to beat the two away after a quick scuffle, but the following hour was beaten and "arrested" by a mob of 10 or so Blue shirts. Seeing the writing on the wall, many of the country's intellectuals, leftists, and politicians went underground or overseas, predicting the ensuing violence that will overtake China. The no so lucky people were paraded in the street, with men and women being beaten until bloody and some even murdered. The sheer brutality on display on the streets of China was so horrific it managed international news, which the name "Chiang" both in and outside of China gradually being seen as that of a monster.

They have covered the city with their slogans and their flags and their books, and they seem to have no sense of slowing down. Many people in the Bejing police have joined the protesters on their side, demanding that Chiang steps down from his office and is arrested for his crimes against the legitimate government of China! They are crying for blood, and Chiang knows it, he knows how much the people hate him, and he is desperately trying to think of a solution. How had Wang managed to keep these people in line for so long? It seemed that every police he enacted to save China, the people would rebel against it and ruin everything! The obvious conclusion, Chiang observed, is that the Chinese people are merely too ignorant to be allowed to have a say either way in the matter. Wang only managed to hold onto power by placating the people and playing on their fears and wants, he was nothing but a manipulator and there had clearly been nothing else to his success as president. As Chiang thought this the protesters managed to reach their way into Tiananmen Square, they began to crowd around the palace, the palace that Chiang happened to currently be inside of. They demanded that the guards let them in so they could have a "Talk" with their beloved president, but the guards, who were Blue Shirts, stood their ground. Before him Chiang had a choice, he could call in the army to neutralize the issue or he could hope and pray that his own people wouldn't kill him.Although the military option sounded preferable, it would also turn even most of the military against him as his popularity continued to tumble. Letting the protesters burn off their steam would put his life at risk and help the socialists spread their message, but it would also allow for the retention of even a small amount of military loyalty within the army."

roc.15.d:0 "General Zhu De had been a military officer nearly all of his life. He had joined the Imperial Army at the age of 20 after finishing his imperial examination, and his successes in the minor bandit conflicts of the 1900s had led him to further glory and prestige within the Armed forces. During the 1912 revolution against the Qing, he had sided with the rebels at his first chance as a lowly officer and rose the ranks once again, becoming a Major and crushing the cursed Imperial forces whenever they had shown their heads. During the Yuan Shikai coup attempt in 1915, he was crushed and the presidency of Sun Yat-sen was continued without much military issue until his sudden death in 1925. In his years under Yat-sen Zhu had believed China had found a true president, and it had, but afterwards the President Wang took the throne of power. Zhu had mixed feelings of Wang, although his administration had been successful it had also been corrupt and a unstable coalition, its continuation happening largely only through Wang's personal charisma. Zhu had long believed his death or deposement would result in the destruction of China unless an heir was appointed before his death, and it turned out he was correct. Now Chiang, Zhu had never had respect for Chiang, the many had coordinated with the Japanese heavily in the days after the revolution, to what end was unknown. It was even said that Chiang organized the Yuan coup attempt, although all evidence to such a case was conjecture at best. Well in his mad reign of power, Chiang had destroyed not only the great nation of China but the legacy of Sun Yat-sen, the man that Zhu had risked it all for. Another pathetic attempt at an emperor had poked his head from the shadows to try and take over everything the Chinese people loved, to throw a black curtain of shame over the pride of the people. Zhu had made his choice, he spoke to his soldiers calm manner and without flourish, speaking of the injustice and cruelties of the Chiang regime and how it betrayed the values of all that he and his soldiers had fought for. He then told his soldiers to board their trucks, and that they were going to fight this regime by going to the revolutionaries who now patrolled almost all the mountains of China and joining their just cause. The people would be free again. Across all of China the majority of the National Revolutionary Army fled to the hills to join their organization of choice, it seems like the Republic's days are numbered."

Well this little muckraking revolutionary will soon be of no issue, as Chiang ordered the Blue Shirts to find him and his lackey Deng and execute them both. Unfortunately for Chiang however, Mao and Deng had already fled to the western region to form and prepare for the coming civil war which by this point almost everyone could see coming. Chiang however, in his hubris, continued to search, and by search I mean burn and rape, the eastern countryside. Much of the peasantry were forced into being refugees, with many of them fleeing Chiang's wrath and joining the newly formed Red Army. These peasants were not joining out of political belief as much as pure pragmatism and survival, Mao had promised the peasants a much, much better deal, and ever the opportunistic people these Chinese farmers took it. The local government of the west had long tired of Chiang's rage and brutality, and in an attempt to avoid bloodshed hid the presence of the Chinese communists within its borders, again out of pragmatism and survival rather then ideological fervor. It would be better to let the Communists build their little farming communes and tool workshops then let the central government destroy their entire region, so the presence of Mao and Deng was tolerated as long as they kept a low profile.

roc.17.d:0 "Well this was unexpected, a force of mixed Japanese and Manchu forces have invaded from Manchuria, claiming the mandate of heaven and their rightful place as the rulers of China. They are nominally led by the Emperor, or Former Emperor, Puyi, although any actual leadership from him is obscured under hundreds of layers of advisers and bureaucrats. Most believe he is nothing but a figurehead, some have even speculated the man is a falsification outright, with the child-emperor Puyi having died during the Revolution. Whatever the case may be, those who are claiming to be the Qing empire have taken the capital of Beijing out of the hands of Dai Li's horrible regime, which had been running the region as essentially an autonomy since Chiang released him from prison. Due to this, the Resorationists were accepted by the local people as a preferable alternative to the sheer brutality and insanity of Dai Li, and the profound idiocy and incompetence of the Chiang Regime. The Imperial Army marched into the city with it's banners high, something that for many had not been seen in decades, and escorted the emperor Puyi to a stage which had actually been created the day before. This was a parade and a performance, in fact the Qing Restorationists had occupied the city days before, but the propaganda value of having the Emperor actually speak to the people was too immense to not pull out all the stops. But as the Emperor stood before the crowd, he began to speak dry words, words that were almost clearly not his nor anywhere near his will. To many of the onlookers he looked as if he had seen his child die in front of him, distraught at the actions which had been done in his name. Of course the official propaganda footage would be edited as would the posters, but those who saw him that day could not forget the sadness in his eyes. If they would have known but Puyi was thinking, they would have significantly less confidence in the new Imperial government then they currently did, but that is exactly the reason Puyi was not allowed to actually speak his mind. He had recently begun to question his legacy due to a new teacher in his inner circle and a new found passion, but to him it wouldn't matter. He was a puppet on strings, his opinions had no value and his will had no strength."

Using his shadowy position and notorious name to form a Cult-State that consolidated its gains quickly, only losing a part of their eastern provinces to a Qing restorationist movement. His personal militia, the Dare to Die corp, have massacured any dissent against his rule, and shrines to folk personifications of death have been set up as state mandated public property. It seems like Chiang's gamble has failed in such a fantastically horrible way that his reputation will never recover, but rest assured his decisions will most probably only get much, much worse."

In front of him laid a choice between pragmatic power move and the maintenance of the smallest element of his legitimacy. Chiang could sacrifice his legitimacy for the help of the Demon Dai Li as the people called him, or he could leave him to rot, allowing there to at least be an element that he had not murder Wang himself. Dai Li was hated by the people, in fact the sheer hatred towards him could not be emphasised merely with thoughts or words, it laid at such a deep and emotional level that it would take a team of professional mental excavators to even try to breach the depths of the hatred. But he was useful, every mission he organized succeeded, every moment he repressed a group they would almost never find themselves in the public eye again, he was efficiency made manifest in the form of a man. What to do what to do, in his younger age Chiang would have been able to bark the order without a second thought, but as he aged he realized that his power had been based on nothing but violence on blood. He did not have supporters, he had collaborators, the people who helped him did so because they actively feared him, not one person was truly loyal to him in any sense. Chiang sat down on a chair within the room facing the barred window in the visitor's center, he lit up a cigarette and contemplated his options with a clearer head. He reminded himself of the mantra he had learned long ago when he had travelled with San Yat Seen, it is better to be feared then to be loved. If he would have to kill millions to maintain his power, he would, because he and he alone is the best option for China. Dai Li was merely another tool in maintaining his rule of fear. Chiang had made up his mind, he yelled at the prison guards: "Free him, and bring him!"."

Chiang Kai-Shek managed to swoop into power like a vulture seeking the carrion of war, taking the position of president in a barely veiled coup against Wang Jingwei, the one man who had managed to have the communists and nationalists exist side by side. His immediate power grab was seen as suspicious by everyone in China, no peasant doubted his treachery and serpentine ways, but by blood Chiang tried to hold on despite his almost universally hated nature. He instituted the One Thousand Pedals initiative to "Clean China of the dirty pedals which now littered it's lands", Chiang had promised that only one thousand pedals, also known as human beings in this case, would need to be swiped away. This was a lie, this was a horrific lie, gangs of Blue Shirt thugs roamed the countryside in the days following the coup, massacring village after village in an attempt to purge the lands of anybody who would dare oppose the rule of Chiang. Unfortunately for Chiang however, all this did was rouse nearly the entire population of the country against him and his Blue Shirts. In an attempt to consolidate power further, he freed the man who had assassinated Wang, Dai Li, and appointed him as his temporary Secretary of Internal Peace and Stability. Dai Li immediately used this power to form a splinter state in the north of the country, calling Chiang a pathetic worm who was unable to do what needed to be done to form a truly pure China.The communists finally rose in the west after this, calling on the peasantry to resist the horrible machinations of the Snake Chiang and the Demon Dai. Qing restorationists rose in the northeast against Dai Li's "National Republic", claiming again the mandate of heaven and calling on the banners to once again unite against the demons which had plagued this land so much for so long. Finally in the far west, the great lands of the Turkic peoples of China raised their swords once again for the will of Allah, striking down against Chiang and his state of Iblis. It appears absolutely everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong, China is again broken and tattered, its blood soaking the fields and rivers it calls its own. Is there no hope for peace, or will China rise again from the ashes, as it always has, to a brighter future?"

roc.21.t:0 "Labor and Blood"
roc.21.d:0 "At the onset of the Chiang regime many laborers from all across China had worried that the rights they had fought for under Wang and his coalition would be lost. Chief among these rights that were feared for were twofold, the rights of workers and the rights of women. Chiang in his infinite wisdom has decided to force through a mandate that all work days must be at least 14 hours a day per law. This has been met with, let us say, a small amount of controlled push back on the side of the population of China. Massive riots have broken out throughout the country, and dozens if not hundreds are now presumed dead. In almost every major city the walls are battered and the glass is broken, carnage and blood wash through the streets of China as the police in most cases have joined the rioters and protesters against the Chiang regime. Currently the only force loyal to Chiang is his beloved blue shirts and parts of the army, both of which have been desperately trying to maintain order, with Beijing especially having become a center of street fighting and barricades. If we do not act fast, then a new Chinese revolution very well may start! But Chiang has to ponder his options, he could simply crush the forming rebellion as it is young, destroying at least this section of opposition as much as he could before turning his attention elsewhere. This could severely hamper our political opposition, but it will also make us devils in the eyes of both our neighbors, the west, and our own people. We could try and mediate the issue, negotiating with the rioters to reduce the work hours to an amount that would still satisfy the government. If we do negotiate, no party will end up being happy, as the workers will still have raised hours and we will not have raised our work efficiency to any terrible degree. Of course there is a third option, we can restore the Wang era 8 hours a day law, which would most probably end many of the riots right here and now and salvage our international reputation. Of course by doing so we will strength the opposition and be seen as weak, but trying to raise the working hours probably wasn't the best idea in the first place regardless. Despite it all, Chiang..."

You thought the police, who support the rioters, and the army, who is already increasingly disloyal by every passing day, wouldn't half ass their repression and let some of the rebels away? You absolute moron, you complete buffoon, you are a complete disgrace to leadership and to the people and government of China. Now there will be mass starvation and almost every city is on fire, just because you wanted that little bit more production when the only thing we truly need right now is stability! Look outside your window, the entire city is up in flames, children are crying for their parents, and the police are helping the rioters flip over government worker's cars. You know that child wouldn't be crying for their parents normally, but sadly their parents are in a fucking factory starving because they have no lunch break, and are are getting paid less and less, all because of you mister President. I am sorry to say this so bluntly, but this entire horrific situation is entirely your fault for being such a stupid fucking moron, and I am resigning my post right here and now. I will not stand by as you make such stupid fucking decisions and destroy this country, and you can try to assassinate me if you may, so be it. Your moronic self would probably end up paying me the money you meant to send the assassin anyways, so its not as if I am in any real danger against your compete buffoonery. Goodbye and burn in hell mister President, and I will hope that one thousand demons tear apart your soul once your pathetic shit stain of a person dies and falls to the underworld." Chiang's minister of industry barged out of the president's room in his ad hoc Presidential palace, spitting on the floor and spouting a variety of slurs and insults towards Chiang as he left the government building most likely for the last time. As he had been screamed at, Chiang had only stood, his jaw ajar, unable to protest but merely accepting the lecture that he had earned. The minister hadn't been lying, the city was indeed on fire, and Chiang could hear gunshots and screams from the outside despite the palace's walled and elevated position within the city. He slumped himself back into his chair, there was nothing that could be done except wait for the riots to be over."

They were nothing but obstacles in the way of progress after all, Chiang had seen how Wang's government had ruined China, it had detached them from the old ways and embraced western ideas of "Equality" and "Liberty", nothing but words now. Chiang finally held the keys to the castle, the throne and the crown, as it were. The people who opposed him shall know fear, as the blood that shall rain down upon the land of China shall feed the new harvest, the harvest of the future. There was only one thorn in his side, and that was the fucking Socialists. The Socialists had made up the majority of Wang's coalition, with a mixture of Communists and Nationalists falling into that block, even Wang himself identified as a "Socialist-Nationalist-Democrat"! They still held the elected power of China, but seeing as Chiang held the actual power of China, they should be nothing but tender roots waiting to be pulled. First things first though, their power base and influence needs to be destroyed, destroy their influence and then bait them into an open fight where they shall be crushed, Sun Tzu would be proud. During the Wang era it had been common to erect statues and other memorabilia dedicated to past Revolutionaries and Nationalists as well as general socialistic symbology, as it was an easy way to please the communists instead of building a new hospital or cooperative. By removing these Chiang could bait the Socialists into a fight easier then crossing a one inch river. He marched back to his new office and phoned the Blue Shirts HQ, "I have a job for you gentlemen, if it isn't too much to ask of course."."
