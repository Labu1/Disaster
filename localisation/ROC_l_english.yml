roc.1.t:0 "Red Star and the Blue Sun"
roc.1.d:0 "The profound victory of Doctor Sun Yat-sen over the Imperial Forces of China flew over like a wave, the people had finally won their freedom against the evil tyranny of the foreign forces of the Qing, and at last China held its head high, the Dragon once again towering in the east. Then after this fantastic victory and the first election in 1925, Sun Yat-sen, the Red General, the President promptly collapsed and died of cancer he had kept secret from everyone who had ever known him. The next day as his wife read his will, it was laid out that to avoid the right wing of the Kuomintang taking power in a election, he would instead run for office himself, knowingly dying soon into his reign but leaving the Left KMT leader Wang Jingwei as President. The right wing attempted an uprising against what they felt was a bastardization of democracy, but Wang managed to crush their forces and hold onto power. His regime saw the implementation of Georgian land reform, the nationalization and expansion of the rail system, a massive increase in literacy and education within the country, and a peaceful if slow development of the economy. But as the next election neared, Wang feared his popularity would not be sufficient, and so in a desperate bid sided himself with the Communist Party of China, who had united with the KMT in 1923 but then split after Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925. The Communists pushed the vote solidly in favor of Wang, with the 1929 elections having 63% of the vote going to the Left KMT and Communist coalition. The Communist-KMT alliance proved itself to be a resounding success despite the early ideological difficulties that plagued the first year of co-policy, as the Communist formed peasant communes that were largely self sufficient while Wang's government managed to develop the major cities that dotted the coast of China. Industry flourished as foreign investors flooded into the country, but were regulated by the strong guiding hand of the Wang regime. It is now 1936, the Communist-KMT alliance is at its height and the people are slowly but surely pushing China to becoming a power to rival Japan in strength. But there are whispers of discontent, the Right KMT has accused the government of rigging elections and mass repressions, and the Wang government has not been friendly to the Turkic peoples or their faith of Islam. Still, it for now seems as if nothing can go wrong."

roc.2.d:0 "Oh most glorious Lord Allah, the most compassionate and merciful, has allowed us this day to free ourselves from the pagan Chinese who cannot see the truth of Isa blessings and peace be upon him nor the Prophet Muhammad blessings and peace be upon him. They have opposed us and our way of life for we worship the only true lord of man, we refused to bow down to their pagan lords in the past and we shall continue to do so today. The army of Isa and Muhammad shall rise up against the infidel Dragon and smash it with the force of one thousand suns, scattering it to the winds until all that is remembered is a hint in the cry of the hills. Our horsemen are unmatched and with unwavering faith shall guide the sword of Islam to victory, there is nothing in our future but success and glory. Allahu Akbar!"

roc.3.d:0 "Death is the most sacred act of a man, for it makes a man whole in that present moment. His being is frozen in time as his time clocks out, like a photograph of the moment before the onset of decay and rot. Our land is plagued with unhonorable death, death that does not bring the best snapshot of how it should be for men to live. By you men dying young, you have established that you are willing to live forever as being young, a photograph of that self within the whirling mass of the afterlife. Our enemies speak of honor but they do not understand it, you, my fellow worshippers of the liberator, must enact that honorable death among China with a viciousness that shall not be seen again for hundreds of years. They shall decry you, but remember that you are their holy guide, you are their prophets, for the only true lord worthy of worship is Doom, Decay, and Death."

Our time again has come, through western corruption and degeneracy our nation fell to liberal ideas of "Modernization" and "Democracy", we now know that these things are poisons to the people of China. The most holy and divine Emperor has raised the banners once again, and the states of China once again feud like frogs in a lily pond. Yet our most glorious Emperor shall make the pond still again, and remove the traitorous flowers which make the brother frogs sick. The Dragon rears its head, and within its mouth rests the enemies of the Emperor!"

Comrade Mao, your time has come to destroy the four reactionaries who plague our lands, the Monarchist, the Theocrat, the Fascist, and the Autocrat. These men are nothing but paper tigers, mice in the face of the power that the Chinese Proletariat and Peasant hold.

roc.6.t:0 "Terrorists Attack at the New Year Celebrations"
roc.6.d:0 "Wang Jingwei had been celebrating the Chinese new year at his home in Beijing with many of his cabinet ministers and members of his party. He and several others went to the balcony to greet the citizens who were also celebrating the new year of the Rat. Wang and his friends, all very drunk, greeted the citizens with great kindness and joy. But what was about to unfold, was quite the contrast. As Wang and his posse went to head back into the home, they heard several gunshots, and then the sound of a gargantuan explosion, followed by many bloodcurdling screams. Wang quickly turned around and looked back, only to see that the streets in front of his home were now painted red with blood and gore. The carnage was simply astounding. He tried his best not to throw up, but the sickening scenes he had just seen convulsed in his mind and forced him to vomit.  The gunshots and explosions could still be heard, but they were now coming from afar. The air had a stench of guts and smoke from the guns and explosion. These attacks could only be traced back to one group: Dai Li, and his supporters. This was clear to Wang almost instantly. Wang ran up to his home's second floor patio to get a better view of the carnage, but that's when the second explosion occurred. The blast from it levelled Wang's home. Search teams spent all night looking for his body in the rubble, but to no success. It seems as though the year of the Rat has gone off to a terrible start..."

roc.18.t:0 "Immediate Regret"
roc.18.d:0 "Chiang's decision to pardon Dai Li in his power play to consolidate power backfired both spectacularly and almost immediately. Within days of his release Dai Li had already started consolidating and forming his own private army, and soon after that swept into the northern mountainous region of China, decrying the Republic of China as weak and westernized and instead embracing a bastardized form of traditional Chinese folk religion which emphasised the doom of humanity, decay, and death. Using his shadowy position and notorious name to form a Cult-State that consolidated its gains quickly, only losing a part of their eastern provinces to a Qing restorationist movement. His personal militia, the Dare to Die corp, have massacured any dissent against his rule, and shrines to folk personifications of death have been set up as state mandated public property. It seems like Chiang's gamble has failed in such a fantastically horrible way that his reputation will never recover, but rest assured his decisions will most probably only get much, much worse."
roc.18.a:0 "Well fuck!"

roc.19.t:0 "Dai Li Pardoned!"
roc.19.d:0 "Chiang sat pacing back and forth in the office of one of the remaining and functioning Chinese Nationalist jails in the country, inside the murderer of the beloved former president sat in his cell. In front of him laid a choice between pragmatic power move and the maintenance of the smallest element of his legitimacy. Chiang could sacrifice his legitimacy for the help of the Demon Dai Li as the people called him, or he could leave him to rot, allowing there to at least be an element that he had not murder Wang himself. Dai Li was hated by the people, in fact the sheer hatred towards him could not be emphasised merely with thoughts or words, it laid at such a deep and emotional level that it would take a team of professional mental excavators to even try to breach the depths of the hatred. But he was useful, every mission he organized succeeded, every moment he repressed a group they would almost never find themselves in the public eye again, he was efficiency made manifest in the form of a man. What to do what to do, in his younger age Chiang would have been able to bark the order without a second thought, but as he aged he realized that his power had been based on nothing but violence on blood. He did not have supporters, he had collaborators, the people who helped him did so because they actively feared him, not one person was truly loyal to him in any sense. Chiang sat down on a chair within the room facing the barred window in the visitor's center, he lit up a cigarette and contemplated his options with a clearer head. He reminded himself of the mantra he had learned long ago when he had travelled with San Yat Seen, it is better to be feared then to be loved. If he would have to kill millions to maintain his power, he would, because he and he alone is the best option for China. Dai Li was merely another tool in maintaining his rule of fear. Chiang had made up his mind, he yelled at the prison guards: "Free him, and bring him!"."

roc.20.t:0 "Chinese Liberation War"
roc.20.d:0 "The explosion destroyed the presidential residence in an instance, like the legends of old the great unifier of China fell on the blade of the demon, and China again would never know peace. Chiang Kai-Shek managed to swoop into power like a vulture seeking the carrion of war, taking the position of president in a barely veiled coup against Wang Jingwei, the one man who had managed to have the communists and nationalists exist side by side. His immediate power grab was seen as suspicious by everyone in China, no peasant doubted his treachery and serpentine ways, but by blood Chiang tried to hold on despite his almost universally hated nature. He instituted the One Thousand Pedals initiative to "Clean China of the dirty pedals which now littered it's lands", Chiang had promised that only one thousand pedals, also known as human beings in this case, would need to be swiped away. This was a lie, this was a horrific lie, gangs of Blue Shirt thugs roamed the countryside in the days following the coup, massacring village after village in an attempt to purge the lands of anybody who would dare oppose the rule of Chiang. Unfortunately for Chiang however, all this did was rouse nearly the entire population of the country against him and his Blue Shirts. In an attempt to consolidate power further, he freed the man who had assassinated Wang, Dai Li, and appointed him as his temporary Secretary of Internal Peace and Stability. Dai Li immediately used this power to form a splinter state in the north of the country, calling Chiang a pathetic worm who was unable to do what needed to be done to form a truly pure China.The communists finally rose in the west after this, calling on the peasantry to resist the horrible machinations of the Snake Chiang and the Demon Dai. Qing restorationists rose in the northeast against Dai Li's "National Republic", claiming again the mandate of heaven and calling on the banners to once again unite against the demons which had plagued this land so much for so long. Finally in the far west, the great lands of the Turkic peoples of China raised their swords once again for the will of Allah, striking down against Chiang and his state of Iblis. It appears absolutely everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong, China is again broken and tattered, its blood soaking the fields and rivers it calls its own. Is there no hope for peace, or will China rise again from the ashes, as it always has, to a brighter future?"
