roc.6.d:0 "Wang Jingwei had been celebrating the Chinese new year at his home in Beijing with many of his cabinet ministers and members of his party. He and several others went to the balcony to greet the citizens who were also celebrating the new year of the Rat. Wang and his friends, all very drunk, greeted the citizens with great kindness and joy. But what was about to unfold, was quite the contrast. As Wang and his posse went to head back into the home, they heard several gunshots, and then the sound of a gargantuan explosion, followed by many bloodcurdling screams. Wang quickly turned around and looked back, only to see that the streets in front of his home were now painted red with blood and gore. The carnage was simply astounding. He tried his best not to throw up, but the sickening scenes he had just seen convulsed in his mind and forced him to vomit.  The gunshots and explosions could still be heard, but they were now coming from afar. The air had a stench of guts and smoke from the guns and explosion. These attacks could only be traced back to one group: Dai Li, and his supporters. This was clear to Wang almost instantly. Wang ran up to his home's second floor patio to get a better view of the carnage, but that's when the second explosion occurred. The blast from it levelled Wang's home. Search teams spent all night looking for his body in the rubble, but to no success. It seems as though the year of the Rat has gone off to a terrible start..."

roc.19.d:0 "Chiang sat pacing back and forth in the office of one of the remaining and functioning Chinese Nationalist jails in the country, inside the murderer of the beloved former president sat in his cell. In front of him laid a choice between pragmatic power move and the maintenance of the smallest element of his legitimacy. Chiang could sacrifice his legitimacy for the help of the Demon Dai Li as the people called him, or he could leave him to rot, allowing there to at least be an element that he had not murder Wang himself. Dai Li was hated by the people, in fact the sheer hatred towards him could not be emphasised merely with thoughts or words, it laid at such a deep and emotional level that it would take a team of professional mental excavators to even try to breach the depths of the hatred. But he was useful, every mission he organized succeeded, every moment he repressed a group they would almost never find themselves in the public eye again, he was efficiency made manifest in the form of a man. What to do what to do, in his younger age Chiang would have been able to bark the order without a second thought, but as he aged he realized that his power had been based on nothing but violence on blood. He did not have supporters, he had collaborators, the people who helped him did so because they actively feared him, not one person was truly loyal to him in any sense. Chiang sat down on a chair within the room facing the barred window in the visitor's center, he lit up a cigarette and contemplated his options with a clearer head. He reminded himself of the mantra he had learned long ago when he had travelled with San Yat Seen, it is better to be feared then to be loved. If he would have to kill millions to maintain his power, he would, because he and he alone is the best option for China. Dai Li was merely another tool in maintaining his rule of fear. Chiang had made up his mind, he yelled at the prison guards: "Free him, and bring him!"."

roc.20.t:0 "Chinese Liberation War"
roc.20.d:0 "The explosion destroyed the presidential residence in an instance, like the legends of old the great unifier of China fell on the blade of the demon, and China again would never know peace. Chiang Kai-Shek managed to swoop into power like a vulture seeking the carrion of war, taking the position of president in a barely veiled coup against Wang Jingwei, the one man who had managed to have the communists and nationalists exist side by side. His immediate power grab was seen as suspicious by everyone in China, no peasant doubted his treachery and serpentine ways, but by blood Chiang tried to hold on despite his almost universally hated nature. He instituted the One Thousand Pedals initiative to "Clean China of the dirty pedals which now littered it's lands", Chiang had promised that only one thousand pedals, also known as human beings in this case, would need to be swiped away. This was a lie, this was a horrific lie, gangs of Blue Shirt thugs roamed the countryside in the days following the coup, massacring village after village in an attempt to purge the lands of anybody who would dare oppose the rule of Chiang. Unfortunately for Chiang however, all this did was rouse nearly the entire population of the country against him and his Blue Shirts. In an attempt to consolidate power further, he freed the man who had assassinated Wang, Dai Li, and appointed him as his temporary Secretary of Internal Peace and Stability. Dai Li immediately used this power to form a splinter state in the north of the country, calling Chiang a pathetic worm who was unable to do what needed to be done to form a truly pure China.The communists finally rose in the west after this, calling on the peasantry to resist the horrible machinations of the Snake Chiang and the Demon Dai. Qing restorationists rose in the northeast against Dai Li's "National Republic", claiming again the mandate of heaven and calling on the banners to once again unite against the demons which had plagued this land so much for so long. Finally in the far west, the great lands of the Turkic peoples of China raised their swords once again for the will of Allah, striking down against Chiang and his state of Iblis. It appears absolutely everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong, China is again broken and tattered, its blood soaking the fields and rivers it calls its own. Is there no hope for peace, or will China rise again from the ashes, as it always has, to a brighter future?"
