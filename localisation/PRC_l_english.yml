prc.1.t:0 "One Thousand Pedals"
prc.1.d:0 "The explosion destroyed the presidential residence in an instance, like the legends of old the great unifier of China fell on the blade of the demon, and China again would never know peace. Chiang Kai-Shek managed to swoop into power like a vulture seeking the carrion of war, taking the position of president in a barely veiled coup against Wang Jingwei, the one man who had managed to have the communists and nationalists exist side by side. His immediate power grab was seen as suspicious by everyone in China, no peasant doubted his treachery and serpentine ways, but by blood Chiang tried to hold on despite his almost universally hated nature. He instituted the One Thousand Pedals initiative to "Clean China of the dirty pedals which now littered it's lands", Chiang had promised that only one thousand pedals, also known as human beings in this case, would need to be swiped away. This was a lie, this was a horrific lie, gangs of Blue Shirt thugs roamed the countryside in the days following the coup, massacring village after village in an attempt to purge the lands of anybody who would dare oppose the rule of Chiang. Unfortunately for Chiang however, all this did was rouse nearly the entire population of the country against him and his Blue Shirts. In an attempt to consolidate power further, he freed the man who had assassinated Wang, Dai Li, and appointed him as his temporary Secretary of Internal Peace and Stability. Dai Li immediately used this power to form a splinter state in the north of the country, calling Chiang a pathetic worm who was unable to do what needed to be done to form a truly pure China. The communists finally rose in the west after this, calling on the peasantry to resist the horrible machinations of the Snake Chiang and the Demon Dai. Qing restorationists rose in the northeast against Dai Li's "National Republic", claiming again the mandate of heaven and calling on the banners to once again unite against the demons which had plagued this land so much for so long. Finally in the far west, the great lands of the Turkic peoples of China raised their swords once again for the will of Allah, striking down against Chiang and his state of Iblis. It appears absolutely everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong, China is again broken and tattered, its blood soaking the fields and rivers it calls its own. Is there no hope for peace, or will China rise again from the ashes, as it always has, to a brighter future?"
