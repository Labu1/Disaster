prc.1.t:0 "One Thousand Pedals"
prc.1.d:0 "The explosion destroyed the presidential residence in an instance, like the legends of old the great unifier of China fell on the blade of the demon, and China again would never know peace. Chiang Kai-Shek managed to swoop into power like a vulture seeking the carrion of war, taking the position of president in a barely veiled coup against Wang Jingwei, the one man who had managed to have the communists and nationalists exist side by side. His immediate power grab was seen as suspicious by everyone in China, no peasant doubted his treachery and serpentine ways, but by blood Chiang tried to hold on despite his almost universally hated nature. He instituted the One Thousand Pedals initiative to "Clean China of the dirty pedals which now littered it's lands", Chiang had promised that only one thousand pedals, also known as human beings in this case, would need to be swiped away. This was a lie, this was a horrific lie, gangs of Blue Shirt thugs roamed the countryside in the days following the coup, massacring village after village in an attempt to purge the lands of anybody who would dare oppose the rule of Chiang. Unfortunately for Chiang however, all this did was rouse nearly the entire population of the country against him and his Blue Shirts. In an attempt to consolidate power further, he freed the man who had assassinated Wang, Dai Li, and appointed him as his temporary Secretary of Internal Peace and Stability. Dai Li immediately used this power to form a splinter state in the north of the country, calling Chiang a pathetic worm who was unable to do what needed to be done to form a truly pure China. The communists finally rose in the west after this, calling on the peasantry to resist the horrible machinations of the Snake Chiang and the Demon Dai. Qing restorationists rose in the northeast against Dai Li's "National Republic", claiming again the mandate of heaven and calling on the banners to once again unite against the demons which had plagued this land so much for so long. Finally in the far west, the great lands of the Turkic peoples of China raised their swords once again for the will of Allah, striking down against Chiang and his state of Iblis. It appears absolutely everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong, China is again broken and tattered, its blood soaking the fields and rivers it calls its own. Is there no hope for peace, or will China rise again from the ashes, as it always has, to a brighter future?"

prc.3.t:0 "On the Issue of Culture"
prc.3.d:0 "Mao and Deng both were not a fan of the more conservative aspects of Chinese society. However experience and life had led Mao to follow a much more radical path against the tradition he saw as gnawing on the bones of Chinese society. Thousands of years of "civilization", all of which had led to a brutal monarchy and foot binding, the rape of wives and the beating of children, to Mao this only proved that the past as it was should die, and in front of it a new revolutionary culture should form. Deng as befitting his more scholarly disposition was not about to allow the destruction of the past to take place. Deng did in fact support women's rights and believed in many of the same things, but he also understood that without the traditions of China to hold it together as a base, China would not remain intact. So to Deng Chinese society must be reformed, its past used to create a new progressive China, the traditions purged of their nastiness and replaced by clean versions of them. Further on from this Mao was completely against religion, believing it to be one of the classical evils that had plagued China and prevented it from moving forward into the future. As expected, Deng took a more moderate and pragmatic path, believing that although religion has many negative aspects, it can have positives as well, and should generally be tolerated in its existence."

prc.4.t:0 "On The Issue of Industry"
prc.4.d:0 "As soon as the party came together, all individuals involved understood there would be disagreements. It was a group of communists and socialists after all, and as the saying goes if you leave a group of communists in a room with a question and a gun, only one man is coming out of there alive. As the guerrilla movement shifted itself into a proper provisional revolutionary government, actually controlling land and managing it in a realistic sense, these questions became more then petty political arguments. So in the grand tradition of Communist movements, the issues on which direction the party would take would be dept with open democratic debate following by adherence to the party line. The first debate was on the issue of industry, and how it would be treated under the current provisional revolutionary government. Mao and his faction shot out with an argument detailing the benefits of a fully nationalized system ran in communal industrial sectors, essentially centralizing industry into what amounted to industrial communes or collectives. Mao stated that by doing so the Chinese people would be able to work in conditions familiar to them as former communal farmers, while also bringing the benefit of greater living standards to the workers themselves, as well as greater workplace democracy due to the communal organization of it. Deng snapped back, pointing out that communes were great and all but without proper direction from above, many factories would fail to organize and would instead slowly devolve into the same feudal system that had plagued China for centuries. Instead, they should organize the factories through state owned and directed corporations, with Deng highlighting the fact that China should develop capitalism before it could develop anything close to socialism. Deng stated the benefits would be vastly greater economic efficiency as well as the growth of state held capital allowing for superior industrial development. The two sides bickered for hours until finally a solution was met... "
prc.4.a:0 "We shall form Industrial Communes, the people shall have greater rights then ever before!"
prc.4.b:0 "We shall form State Corporations, the material conditions must prior be met."

prc.5.t:0 "On The Issue of Agriculture"
prc.5.d:0 "Deng and Mao continued to scream at each other for hours on the party congress floor, which had become a daily event in the region owned by the socialist revolutionaries. Insults were flung constantly, from "Revisionist" to "Class Traitor" to "Utopian" and "Left Communist", neither side seemed to have any inclination of stopping any time soon. The current issue on the floor was the issue of agriculture in China, this is something that both sides had rather extremely different perspectives on, and neither side was budging. Mao gave his speech one more time, citing the absolutely essential nature that the communalization of agriculture posed. By communalizing agriculture the peasants of China could acquire more rights then they had ever had before, being largely self sufficient, and would allow for the rural regions of China to have a large surplus of agricultural goods. These improvements in standards of living in rural regions would increase the population at a faster rate by allowing greater leisure time for the farmers to pursue education and family life. Deng, on the other hand, argued for the the "soft" collectivization of agriculture, allowing some private farms while also having massive centralized farming collectives to produce as much food as possible. Deng understood that this would not exactly be an improvement of the rights of the Chinese peasantry, but in the long term it would allow for the abolition of the Chinese peasantry as a class, in the end only having industrial farms that would only require a very small farmer population. Deng also shot back at Mao, saying his plan would ignore the all important Urban centers and leave China undeveloped. After a few more hours of argumentation, an agreement was reached..."
prc.5.a:0 "The Peasantry shall work and live as free men in autonomous communes!"
prc.5.b:0 "The Peasantry shall work in centralized farming groups that sell their goods on the market."

prc.6.t:0 "On The Issue of Government"
prc.6.d:0 "Mao and Deng once again sat at opposing ends of the party congress, arguing their case to the greater party membership. The current issue on the floor was a big one, how should the post-war government be organized and what should the power of the leadership be? The two factions once again rose from their seats and began to scream at each other insistently, with the two cases being presented in a rough but effective manner. Mao declared that the government should be organized as, like most other things in Mao's ideal state, communally. Following the Russian example of "Soviets", the government would be a series of democratically elected councils until finally reaching the Grand Council, which would be the primary organ of the state. The higher leadership of China such as Mao himself would act as guidance and advisers as part of the higher party congress, but would not interfere with the machinations of the Grand Council and it's political decisions. Deng said that this system would only breed corruption like so many of Mao's ideas before, and that instead the party should look to the American system for inspiration. There should be a President of China with broad executive powers, as well as the party congress becoming the national congress, organized on the same lines but functioning as the primary machine of the state. A senate would be created to confirm the actions of the congress, and a supreme court would be used to settle judicial manners. Of course this system would be more socialistic then the American system, with lobbying and other such elements of corruption being abolish, but this system in the eyes of Deng would allow China to once again be stable and whole."
