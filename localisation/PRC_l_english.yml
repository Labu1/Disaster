prc.1.t:0 "One Thousand Pedals"
prc.1.d:0 "The explosion destroyed the presidential residence in an instance, like the legends of old the great unifier of China fell on the blade of the demon, and China again would never know peace. Chiang Kai-Shek managed to swoop into power like a vulture seeking the carrion of war, taking the position of president in a barely veiled coup against Wang Jingwei, the one man who had managed to have the communists and nationalists exist side by side. His immediate power grab was seen as suspicious by everyone in China, no peasant doubted his treachery and serpentine ways, but by blood Chiang tried to hold on despite his almost universally hated nature. He instituted the One Thousand Pedals initiative to "Clean China of the dirty pedals which now littered it's lands", Chiang had promised that only one thousand pedals, also known as human beings in this case, would need to be swiped away. This was a lie, this was a horrific lie, gangs of Blue Shirt thugs roamed the countryside in the days following the coup, massacring village after village in an attempt to purge the lands of anybody who would dare oppose the rule of Chiang. Unfortunately for Chiang however, all this did was rouse nearly the entire population of the country against him and his Blue Shirts. In an attempt to consolidate power further, he freed the man who had assassinated Wang, Dai Li, and appointed him as his temporary Secretary of Internal Peace and Stability. Dai Li immediately used this power to form a splinter state in the north of the country, calling Chiang a pathetic worm who was unable to do what needed to be done to form a truly pure China. The communists finally rose in the west after this, calling on the peasantry to resist the horrible machinations of the Snake Chiang and the Demon Dai. Qing restorationists rose in the northeast against Dai Li's "National Republic", claiming again the mandate of heaven and calling on the banners to once again unite against the demons which had plagued this land so much for so long. Finally in the far west, the great lands of the Turkic peoples of China raised their swords once again for the will of Allah, striking down against Chiang and his state of Iblis. It appears absolutely everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong, China is again broken and tattered, its blood soaking the fields and rivers it calls its own. Is there no hope for peace, or will China rise again from the ashes, as it always has, to a brighter future?"
prc.1.a:0 "Paper tigers the lot of them!"

prc.2.t:0 "Polycephaly"
prc.2.d:0 "Mao and Deng had both become the principle leaders of the Chinese Socialist and Communist movement ever since the assassination of Wang and the destruction of the official Communist party of China, which had been brutally raided and destroyed by Chiang after he somehow managed to blame the Communists for killing their number one ally. Both of them were however on opposite ends of the political spectrum within the party as well as on oppose ends of education when it came to politics. Deng had written and wrote Marxist theory before the Wang incident, and was well educated in the ways of politics and economics, as well as in theory ranging from Fascism to Marxism. Personally Deng identified himself as an Orthodox Marxist or a "True" Marxist, believing that in order for socialism to be possible the material conditions must be met, and by that logic those same material conditions must be accelerated in China. In practice Deng did not act much like a socialist, instead supporting a state capitalist economy with heavy elements of corporatism and economic planning, but his views were popular with the intelligentsia, urban population, as well as the far left and right wing of the party. Mao was in many ways the antithesis, Mao had never actually read any Marxist theory before, using most of his time as a librarian and then further on a master of records to study the culture of China versus the West and military theory. To Mao socialism was achievable through the use of communal democracy and the decentralization of the state, taking influence from the Chinese Anarchists who Mao had interacted with earlier in his youth. Mao technically considered himself a Marxist, but most often simply referred to himself as a Chinese Socialist or a Chinese Communist, neither of which especially fit his viewpoints. Mao is popular with the left and center of the party, as well as the massive peasant population of China and anti-traditionalist activists."
prc.2.a:0 "This agreement does not seem to be especially stable"

prc.3.t:0 "On the Issue of Culture"
prc.3.d:0 "Mao and Deng both were not a fan of the more conservative aspects of Chinese society. However experience and life had led Mao to follow a much more radical path against the tradition he saw as gnawing on the bones of Chinese society. Thousands of years of "civilization", all of which had led to a brutal monarchy and foot binding, the rape of wives and the beating of children, to Mao this only proved that the past as it was should die, and in front of it a new revolutionary culture should form. Deng as befitting his more scholarly disposition was not about to allow the destruction of the past to take place. Deng did in fact support women's rights and believed in many of the same things, but he also understood that without the traditions of China to hold it together as a base, China would not remain intact. So to Deng Chinese society must be reformed, its past used to create a new progressive China, the traditions purged of their nastiness and replaced by clean versions of them. Further on from this Mao was completely against religion, believing it to be one of the classical evils that had plagued China and prevented it from moving forward into the future. As expected, Deng took a more moderate and pragmatic path, believing that although religion has many negative aspects, it can have positives as well, and should generally be tolerated in its existence."

prc.4.t:0 "On The Issue of Industry"
prc.4.d:0 "As soon as the party came together, all individuals involved understood there would be disagreements. It was a group of communists and socialists after all, and as the saying goes if you leave a group of communists in a room with a question and a gun, only one man is coming out of there alive. As the guerrilla movement shifted itself into a proper provisional revolutionary government, actually controlling land and managing it in a realistic sense, these questions became more then petty political arguments. So in the grand tradition of Communist movements, the issues on which direction the party would take would be dept with open democratic debate following by adherence to the party line. The first debate was on the issue of industry, and how it would be treated under the current provisional revolutionary government. Mao and his faction shot out with an argument detailing the benefits of a fully nationalized system ran in communal industrial sectors, essentially centralizing industry into what amounted to industrial communes or collectives. Mao stated that by doing so the Chinese people would be able to work in conditions familiar to them as former communal farmers, while also bringing the benefit of greater living standards to the workers themselves, as well as greater workplace democracy due to the communal organization of it. Deng snapped back, pointing out that communes were great and all but without proper direction from above, many factories would fail to organize and would instead slowly devolve into the same feudal system that had plagued China for centuries. Instead, they should organize the factories through state owned and directed corporations, with Deng highlighting the fact that China should develop capitalism before it could develop anything close to socialism. Deng stated the benefits would be vastly greater economic efficiency as well as the growth of state held capital allowing for superior industrial development. The two sides bickered for hours until finally a solution was met... "
prc.4.a:0 "We shall form Industrial Communes, the people shall have greater rights then ever before!"
prc.4.b:0 "We shall form State Corporations, the material conditions must prior be met."

prc.5.t:0 "On The Issue of Agriculture"
prc.5.d:0 "Deng and Mao continued to scream at each other for hours on the party congress floor, which had become a daily event in the region owned by the socialist revolutionaries. Insults were flung constantly, from "Revisionist" to "Class Traitor" to "Utopian" and "Left Communist", neither side seemed to have any inclination of stopping any time soon. The current issue on the floor was the issue of agriculture in China, this is something that both sides had rather extremely different perspectives on, and neither side was budging. Mao gave his speech one more time, citing the absolutely essential nature that the communalization of agriculture posed. By communalizing agriculture the peasants of China could acquire more rights then they had ever had before, being largely self sufficient, and would allow for the rural regions of China to have a large surplus of agricultural goods. These improvements in standards of living in rural regions would increase the population at a faster rate by allowing greater leisure time for the farmers to pursue education and family life. Deng, on the other hand, argued for the the "soft" collectivization of agriculture, allowing some private farms while also having massive centralized farming collectives to produce as much food as possible. Deng understood that this would not exactly be an improvement of the rights of the Chinese peasantry, but in the long term it would allow for the abolition of the Chinese peasantry as a class, in the end only having industrial farms that would only require a very small farmer population. Deng also shot back at Mao, saying his plan would ignore the all important Urban centers and leave China undeveloped. After a few more hours of argumentation, an agreement was reached..."
prc.5.a:0 "The Peasantry shall work and live as free men in autonomous communes!"
prc.5.b:0 "The Peasantry shall work in centralized farming groups that sell their goods on the market."

prc.6.t:0 "On The Issue of Government"
prc.6.d:0 "Mao and Deng once again sat at opposing ends of the party congress, arguing their case to the greater party membership. The current issue on the floor was a big one, how should the post-war government be organized and what should the power of the leadership be? The two factions once again rose from their seats and began to scream at each other insistently, with the two cases being presented in a rough but effective manner. Mao declared that the government should be organized as, like most other things in Mao's ideal state, communally. Following the Russian example of "Soviets", the government would be a series of democratically elected councils until finally reaching the Grand Council, which would be the primary organ of the state. The higher leadership of China such as Mao himself would act as guidance and advisers as part of the higher party congress, but would not interfere with the machinations of the Grand Council and it's political decisions. Deng said that this system would only breed corruption like so many of Mao's ideas before, and that instead the party should look to the American system for inspiration. There should be a President of China with broad executive powers, as well as the party congress becoming the national congress, organized on the same lines but functioning as the primary machine of the state. A senate would be created to confirm the actions of the congress, and a supreme court would be used to settle judicial manners. Of course this system would be more socialistic then the American system, with lobbying and other such elements of corruption being abolish, but this system in the eyes of Deng would allow China to once again be stable and whole."

prc.12.t:0 "The Strangest Proposal In History"
prc.12.d:0 "Deng honestly could not believe the letter that sat on his desk, but it clearly sat there, insulting him and staring back at him with its mere presence. It had come from a spy Deng had planted inside the Qing a few weeks earlier in an attempt to poke out logistical and political weaknesses within the state, and his spy had found out two central things. The Qing were almost entirely militarily reliant on Japanese equipment and arms, often the equipment would simply have the Japanese proof marks and symbols crudely painted over or scratched out by company quartermasters. Secondly, the Emperor Puyi absolutely and unequivocally hated his current position as Emperor. The man, from what the spy had written, was in fact a rather gentle soul, unsuited to warfare or in honesty governance at all. He was living the life of a monarch but all evidence suggested his heart bled for the actions done in his name. Importantly, the spy had been posing as a eunuch within the recently reoccupied Forbidden City palace Puyi had been staying at, and he had heard the Emperor lament the situation of the civil war. He had verbally decried the Demon Dai Li and the bastard Chiang, and had implied that an ally, any ally, would be preferable to having to bend his people's knee to those bloodthirsty monsters and traitorous snakes. The spy had sensed potential in that sentiment and sent Deng authorization to send Puyi a letter stating interest in forming a non-aggression pact between the two waring states. Deng had thought nothing of it, although it was probably destined to fail there was no point in not at least trying, or using any help they could get. So the letter had been sent, and now, the response had come directly to Deng himself. It was a letter in gold imperial leaf paper and black ink, decorated as if it was going to be sent to a fellow king rather then a communist rebel. Puyi's response was simple, or at least as simple as any imperial message can be with all of its poetics and long statements. Puyi was interested in pursuing dialog with the Communists, and with the promise of the Emperor stated his soldiers would no longer fire upon Communist forces as long as the Communists did the same. This had not been what Deng had expected to find on his desk, but ever the pragmatist he understood good news when he saw it."

prc.13.t:0 "The Fox and the Swan"
prc.13.d:0 "After Deng had notified Mao of what had happened in relation to Puyi, well Mao was shocked, yes, but also a little bit furious. Mao yelled as he usually did, saying that Den had betrayed the revolution and that we was a Revisionist and that he would never in his life side with a noble let alone an Emperor. Deng was insistent however, one less front to worry about was thousands less dead on their part, and it wasn't as if they couldn't just absorb or conquer Puyi after the war anyways. Deng, sensing another implosion, shut Mao down before he even started and recommended that he actually go and meet the Emperor. They needed somebody there to negotiate after all, and Deng was currently too busy organizing factory production to actually go there. Mao grumbled and mumbled, but he wasn't an idiot, and so he and a small squad of Guerrillas sneaked their way into Beijing to meet the Emperor. Once they got to the city they were stopped by the Imperial Guard who guarded it, but Mao presented the letter from Puyi and told him that the Communists and the Qing were now at the very least not enemies. The guard flinched, but he did not argue with the rag tag band of peasants in military greys and blues and said they would be able to request an escort at the guard barracks, as was proper when meeting royalty. The scene was almost comical, the "Great Peasant Lord Mao" as the imperial crier titled him walked up the steps of the Imperial palace in his dirty light blue uniform, flanked by his similarly dressed men and women soldiers and Imperial Guards in their shining gold inlaid uniforms. The door men bowed as Mao and his entourage entered the massive building, a gesture Mao and his soldiers did not return much to the chagrin of all those present. On the far end of the room there was a massive golden and jade throne, flanked on all sides by advisers and servants of all shapes and sizes. The man on the throne, unlike his servants, did not wince when Mao forgot to bow, and, when he finally did, did so in a sloppy and untrained manner. He was a thin and smaller man in glasses, unassuming if it was not that he was the Emperor. He stared at Mao and, to the shock of all those present, walked down from his throne to greet him. Throughout the coming negotiations Mao realized that despite his faults, he rather came to like the little man. Best of all, he was very receptive towards not only being an ally, but being absorbed by the Communists outright!"

prc.14.t:0 "An Unholy Agreement"
prc.14.d:0 "Mao and Puyi sat across from each other in the Emperor's third tea room, which was of course his favorite. The two had come to bond over the days spent in each others company, much to the shock and awe of both Mao's Guerrillas and Puyi's Imperial Guard. It was in fact through this shock that the Guerrillas and the Imperial Guard had managed to start a dialogue between each other, and over the days the two groups had found much in common in their service and their core philosophies, even if they were radically different in many other ways. In fact as the final meeting between the Fox and the Swan was underway, the two groups were outside smoking cigarettes and playing cards. As Mao and Puyi sit and sipped tea, the two read over the argument the states had come to, despite the treaty being mutually agreeable both sides wanted to make sure there were no extra caveats. Puyi and the Qing would be absorbed into the true Chinese Republic, with the guarantee that the Manchu would be treated with equality and respect, that the banners would be maintained, and that Puyi would continue as the Emperor of China in a ceremonial capacity. Although Puyi had not wanted it, he had been pressured by advisers to secure himself a vague position within the government of the Socialists, to maintain political relevance and social status among the people of China. Mao had uncharacteristically agreed to these concessions, but the considerable pressure from Deng and his faction as well as the budding friendship he now had with Puyi, it was very difficult for him not to accept the conditions as they were presented. The idea of Monarchy disgusted Mao, but perhaps it was to be that the material conditions would have to fade away by themselves rather then be brutally suppressed. Even considering that Deng was right about something disgusted Mao, but considering the situation he was in there was not much he could use to cope with that very probable fact. Later that day the agreement was signed by both parties and ratified by the Imperial Court and the Party Congress, both of which were utterly confused by the message but never the less accepting of the situation that had been presented before them. It was now official, the Qing were now fighting alongside the Socialists, an unholy alliance indeed!"
