ngu.1.t:0 "Situation Of The NGPU"
ngu.1.d:0 "I HATE NIGGERS"
ngu.1.a:0 "Wörwards!"

ngu.2.t:0 "The Food Shortages"
ngu.2.d:0 "The complaints about food shortages in suburban areas have increased lately, and the locals want resources diverted to them from the factories in order to feed their families. The suburbs generally contain 'skilled laborers', or as the Capitalists call it:'The Middle Class'. Many politicians in the NGPU has supported the local's demands, but one conglomerate of political entities oppose. The DAP and it's civillian/military counterparts of SF and DNL has been publishing propaganda posters about the supposed 'Greater Goal' that the skilled laborers must go through in order to be stronger people for their nation, and that the government should focus on instead industrilization so that we can feed future generations too. This take has been very popular between the working class because it does not prioritize a single group that the workers have no connection in their labor. The youth has also grown interest to these propaganda posters of the radicals, and our agents say that the DAF is planning to unite all the groups under an opposition clique. What will we do?"
ngu.2.a:0 "Pass the program, and divert resources from factories! We do not bend to fascist scum!"
ngu.2.b:0 "Comprimise the act between the NGPU and DAP-DNL-SF."

ngu.3.t:0 "Legacy Of Marx"
ngu.3.d:0 "Interesting stuff happen in Germany every day, but we couldn't expect this. The radical groups of SF has been spreading propaganda about Marx, our grandmaster, being a Ultranationalist Communist, or more refferd amongst the youth as "National Bolshevik", as a clear insult to our ideology. The SF-DNL-NAP trio has insulted Liebknecht and Luxemburg, calling them "coward revisionists". They believe that Socialism must have a strong basis on class, nation, race and land, just like some famous fascists! What should we do on the matter, reform the curricilum to diss these bandits or do nothing? "
ngu.3.a:0 "Marx is a crucial icon for our revolution, we will not forgive such insult to our godfather. The curricilum stays!"
ngu.3.b:0 "Is it really worth fighting a civil war against some teenagers for a grumpy German Jew?"

ngu.4.t:0 "Class Warfare"
ngu.4.d:0 "d"
ngu.4.a:0 "Bash the capitalists of Germany! Revolution forever!"
ngu.4.b:0 "Classes must be expanded and must work together in order to achieve a REAL revolution!"

ngu.5.t:0 "The Bureau Bombing"
ngu.5.d:0 "The Council has taken a huge blow by the latest happenings in Westphalia. A group of Schwarze Front militans have occupied certain state property such as bureaus of defence and welfare, and was only repelled after the NGPU milita intervened. The commander behind the attack was questioned, and it was discovered that the SF wanted to push for recognition of themselves and their allies as legitimate organizations. The SF is known for their ties to the Deutsche Nationale League and Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, which are effective entities in the politics of The NGPU. DAP is an official faction led by the notorious and charismatic Joseph Goebbels, and the DNL is lead by a new figure, Adolf Hitler. The Strasserists of SF and these politically and militarily active groups working together is very risky to our legitimacy because of their radical reactionary ideals and their popularity amongst our only pillars that carry this roof:\n\n\nThe Working Man."
ngu.5.a:0 "Keep them under our watch."
ngu.5.b:0 "Give the DAF,SF and DNL recognition. We can not rival these beasts!"

ngu.6.t:0 "Operation Rote"
ngu.6.d:0 "The people of Hannover woke up with soldiers marching and bands playing traditional German pieces. Today was expected to be a great day for the working man, because the first official SF-NDL-DAP rally was going to be held. The streets were filled with young men with soldiers and common folk with hopes in their hearts. Homewer, not everyone was so happy and accepting of this "rally", with bunch of NGPU militants and gangsters protesting the rally around the hall. Hoeltz was also not very pleasent about this occurance. Earlier that day he was notified of this rally, and he ordered for NGPU security to be deployed in order to defuse any crisis or to start one if needed. While Hoeltz was watching the rally from his premier room, the leaders of the organizations went on the stage, and a giant applause erupted from the ambitious, yet curious crowd.\n\n\n "Welcome my people, the people of the ancient and divine lands of Germania!" cheered Goebbels, and the crowd clapped. "Here we stand today with my fellow comrades, Adolf Hitler and Otto Strasser! But my folk, do not forget that we can stand on this stage only because you have trusted in us and our ideals of the National Revolution! We have gathered the trust of the farmer, the skilled laborer, the worker, the artist, the soldier and the youth, which are the hopes of Germany! We are here to advise Hoeltz's bandit junta on some matters, because we can clearly see that him and his optimist revolutionaries can't run shit! The outages in Westphalia, the ignorance of dying people of Germany.. These can not be ignored, Mr.Hoeltz!" \n\n With every roaring of Goebbels, Hoeltz and the Revolutionary Guard became more angry and serious about dismantling these bandits. Hoeltz called one of his officers, and told him to quickly write an executive order to dismantle the rally and destroy it's leaders. The officer returned to Hoeltz in 5 minutes and shakingly said "Here's Order Rot, my Premier.". Hoeltz inspected the order and approved it. The officer then connected to the radios of the revolutionary guards in the rally and said "Initiate Order Rot, destroy whatever is there!". The radio noises were heard by the paramilitaries, that are arguing and fighting with the guards, causing them to draw their weapons and shoot.\n\n Shortly after, the city center was turned into a bloody mess, the fight of two tyrants. Goebbels was quickly escorted by the partizans and ordered Hitler and Otto to lead their men into victory. After the bloodshed ended..."
ngu.6.a:0 "We have finally purged the red radicals, real revolution is here!"
ngu.6.b:0 "The bandit revolutionaries are no more. Arbeiter, Bauern, fester die Waffen!"

ngu.7.t:0 "The Schleswig Breach"
ngu.7.d:0 ""
ngu.7.a:0 "Another Judeo-Bolshevik plan destroyed!"

ngu.8.t:0 "Red Sun over Germania"
ngu.8.d:0 "Sweet brother wars...\nJust like in 1866, a war would decide Germany's fate, a war which was fought between Germanic brothers would become reality once again after The People's Führer declared war on the State of Prussia which he refered to as nothing more than a ''Judeo-Bolshevik state of deceit and lies''. The war quickly turned in the NGPU's favor, with them quickly seizing Berlin. The People's Führer celebrated the capture of the city by holding a huge victory parade with him overseeing it with two of his most important followers, Adolf Hitler and Otto Strasser. In an official decree he renamed Berlin to ''Germania'' the great city of Germans. And only Germans..."
ngu.8.a:0 "Sieg Heil!"

ngu.9.t:0 "The Chancellor Vote"
ngu.9.d:0 "With the Northwestern Communists Beating their judeo-bolshevik nemesis Prussia, to celebrate their victory, Goebbels allowed for the Reichstag to choose between two candidates for chancellor, both of them having very different opinions on how to lead Germany into the new age. The first candidate being Otto Strasser the younger of the Strasser brothers. He calls for wealth redistribution between the working class whilst also holding onto the ideals of Ultranationalism and Anti-Semitism. The second candidate being the so called Adolf Hitler who raised through the ranks with his charismatic speech abilities. While all his views may not line up with Goebbels's he's very popular within several circles of the army, believing in the ideas of ''Lebensraum'' or simply living space. What this means so far is quite obvious to the public, but with fervent nationalism in the air the score might be set for Hitler and his clique. Germany's at crossroads, whether it for be the better or the worse..."
ngu.9.a:0 "Mr.Hitler rises to the position of Chancellor! Long Live Germania!"
ngu.9.b:0 "Mr.Strasser rises to the position of Chancellor! To Save Europe!"


ngu.16.t:0 "The Army Removes Goebbels"
ngu.16.d:0 "As time flies, new and new faces appear out of the oblivion, preparing to overthrow the faces of the old. As the beloved People's Führer marched on to claim what him and his clique believed was destined to be under the German worker's control. While Goebbels ''liberated'' these lands the army seized a large amount of influence both in the newly conquered lands and on the homeland front, with it's main figurehead Adolf Hitler's promoting them as the defenders of the German ideals and beliefs. Soon enough Hitler and the Wehrmacht seized the opportunity and successfully ousted the People's Führer from power. While many thought he would end up being imprisoned or even worse, executed, the new regime ensured pensions and a grand mansion for the ex-leader of the country. Germany's fate is now sealed to the hands of the military, and their ideals might be more radical than Goebbels's ever would be..."
ngu.16.a:0 "We will secure the state until a succesor is appointable!"

ngu.18.t:0 "The Wolf Knight and The Young Officer"
ngu.18.d:0 "Ablrecht was too busy watching the beautiful city of Berlin from the Führer's office, again. He served the Reich as one of the many secretaries that Mr.Goebbels had for a while, and then was transferred to be a private personell of Chancellor Adolf Hitler. His relationship with Hitler was one of admiration, just like how many other young Germans admired this hero.\n But today was diffrent.\n Hearing the marching sounds of the soldiers in the hall, Ablrecht quickly took his salute form and waited, just to see the soldiers lining around this odd man with a black suit. Hitler never wore a black suit. The odd man approached to the Fuhrer's table, and turned on the radio. Albrecht shouted in confusion: \n "That is the property of Reichsführer Joseph Goebbels, and only can be used by him or Chancellor Adolf Hitler. I must order you to stop, or I will use force!".\n Young Albrecht then looked up, just to realize that the odd looking man was no one other than the infamous Reinhard Heydrich, the Wolf-Knight of Russia.\n "You must have great courage to commit to words this bold against me, I am impressed. I'd take you to my own personal secretary group but sadly, you didn't know we got rid of old cripple Goebbels last night and installed my rule. Hitler is still the chancellor, but he is going to be curbed soon. Now, give me your arm."\n Albrecht was shaking in fear but still decided to give his arm to Heydrich, just for the Wolf-Knight to carve a symbol on it using his blade. Albrecht couldn't scream, because if he did, he'd be killed so he tried his best to resist the pain. Heyderich had a smug look on his face after he was done carving Albrecht and turned back to the do radio to give an order:\n "Execute Order 98, execute every personell that still wears Goebbels' imagery OR has the Wolf-Knight Mark, no questions asked.""
