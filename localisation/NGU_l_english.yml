ngu.1.t:0 "Situation Of The NGPU"
ngu.1.d:0 "I HATE NIGGERS"
ngu.1.a:0 "Wörwards!"

ngu.2.t:0 "The Food Shortages"
ngu.2.d:0 "The complaints about food shortages in suburban areas have increased lately, and the locals want resources diverted to them from the factories in order to feed their families. The suburbs generally contain 'skilled laborers', or as the Capitalists call it:'The Middle Class'. Many politicians in the NGPU has supported the local's demands, but one conglomerate of political entities oppose. The DAP and it's civillian/military counterparts of SF and DNL has been publishing propaganda posters about the supposed 'Greater Goal' that the skilled laborers must go through in order to be stronger people for their nation, and that the government should focus on instead industrilization so that we can feed future generations too. This take has been very popular between the working class because it does not prioritize a single group that the workers have no connection in their labor. The youth has also grown interest to these propaganda posters of the radicals, and our agents say that the DAF is planning to unite all the groups under an opposition clique. What will we do?"
ngu.2.a:0 "Pass the program, and divert resources from factories! We do not bend to fascist scum!"
ngu.2.b:0 "Comprimise the act between the NGPU and DAP-DNL-SF."

ngu.3.t:0 "Legacy Of Marx"
ngu.3.d:0 "Interesting stuff happen in Germany every day, but we couldn't expect this. The radical groups of SF has been spreading propaganda about Marx, our grandmaster, being a Ultranationalist Communist, or more refferd amongst the youth as "National Bolshevik", as a clear insult to our ideology. The SF-DNL-NAP trio has insulted Liebknecht and Luxemburg, calling them "coward revisionists". They believe that Socialism must have a strong basis on class, nation, race and land, just like some famous fascists! What should we do on the matter, reform the curricilum to diss these bandits or do nothing? "
ngu.3.a:0 "Marx is a crucial icon for our revolution, we will not forgive such insult to our godfather. The curricilum stays!"
ngu.3.b:0 "Is it really worth fighting a civil war against some teenagers for a grumpy German Jew?"

ngu.4.t:0 "Class Warfare"
ngu.4.d:0 "d"
ngu.4.a:0 "Bash the capitalists of Germany! Revolution forever!"
ngu.4.b:0 "Classes must be expanded and must work together in order to achieve a REAL revolution!"

ngu.5.t:0 "The Bureau Bombing"
ngu.5.d:0 "The Council has taken a huge blow by the latest happenings in Westphalia. A group of Schwarze Front militans have occupied certain state property such as bureaus of defence and welfare, and was only repelled after the NGPU milita intervened. The commander behind the attack was questioned, and it was discovered that the SF wanted to push for recognition of themselves and their allies as legitimate organizations. The SF is known for their ties to the Deutsche Nationale League and Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, which are effective entities in the politics of The NGPU. DAP is an official faction led by the notorious and charismatic Joseph Goebbels, and the DNL is lead by a new figure, Adolf Hitler. The Strasserists of SF and these politically and militarily active groups working together is very risky to our legitimacy because of their radical reactionary ideals and their popularity amongst our only pillars that carry this roof:\n\n\nThe Working Man."
ngu.5.a:0 "Keep them under our watch."
ngu.5.b:0 "Give the DAF,SF and DNL recognition. We can not rival these beasts!"

ngu.6.t:0 "Operation Rote"
ngu.6.d:0 "The people of Hannover woke up with soldiers marching and bands playing traditional German pieces. Today was expected to be a great day for the working man, because the first official SF-NDL-DAP rally was going to be held. The streets were filled with young men with soldiers and common folk with hopes in their hearts. Homewer, not everyone was so happy and accepting of this "rally", with bunch of NGPU militants and gangsters protesting the rally around the hall. Hoeltz was also not very pleasent about this occurance. Earlier that day he was notified of this rally, and he ordered for NGPU security to be deployed in order to defuse any crisis or to start one if needed. While Hoeltz was watching the rally from his premier room, the leaders of the organizations went on the stage, and a giant applause erupted from the ambitious, yet curious crowd.\n\n\n "Welcome my people, the people of the ancient and divine lands of Germania!" cheered Goebbels, and the crowd clapped. "Here we stand today with my fellow comrades, Adolf Hitler and Otto Strasser! But my folk, do not forget that we can stand on this stage only because you have trusted in us and our ideals of the National Revolution! We have gathered the trust of the farmer, the skilled laborer, the worker, the artist, the soldier and the youth, which are the hopes of Germany! We are here to advise Hoeltz's bandit junta on some matters, because we can clearly see that him and his optimist revolutionaries can't run shit! The outages in Westphalia, the ignorance of dying people of Germany.. These can not be ignored, Mr.Hoeltz!" \n\n With every roaring of Goebbels, Hoeltz and the Revolutionary Guard became more angry and serious about dismantling these bandits. Hoeltz called one of his officers, and told him to quickly write an executive order to dismantle the rally and destroy it's leaders. The officer returned to Hoeltz in 5 minutes and shakingly said "Here's Order Rot, my Premier.". Hoeltz inspected the order and approved it. The officer then connected to the radios of the revolutionary guards in the rally and said "Initiate Order Rot, destroy whatever is there!". The radio noises were heard by the paramilitaries, that are arguing and fighting with the guards, causing them to draw their weapons and shoot.\n\n Shortly after, the city center was turned into a bloody mess, the fight of two tyrants. Goebbels was quickly escorted by the partizans and ordered Hitler and Otto to lead their men into victory. After the bloodshed ended..."
ngu.6.a:0 "We have finally purged the red radicals, real revolution is here!"
ngu.6.b:0 "The bandit revolutionaries are no more. Arbeiter, Bauern, fester die Waffen!"
