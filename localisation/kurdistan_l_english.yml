KUR_hamidiye_army_desc:0"A reformation of the original Tribal cavalry formed under Sultan Abdul Hamid II, the Hamidian Tribal Cavalry, or simply the Hamidiye, are a formation of light cavalry forces that find their use as a frontier and border protection force alongside policing activities in regions such as Armenia. It's ranks are almost entirely Kurdish, but can have a variety of different ethnic groups within it. Brutally effective, they are notorious for their actions against the Armenian population within the Ottoman Empire, and with their re-foundation it seems as if their purpose will again be the same."
