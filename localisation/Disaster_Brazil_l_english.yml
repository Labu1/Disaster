bra.1.t:0 "Integralists march on São Paulo!"
bra.1.d:0 "A country of political turmoil and strife, one could forgive Brazilians for believing that their country needs to be put at rest politically, but it appears that is not the case. Supporters of integralist groups across the nation descended upon São Paulo today, claiming that Getúlio Vargas has failed Brazil, and does not hold God in his heart like a righteous man. Vargas is yet to comment."
bra.1.a:0 "Let them speak, who are we to censor free speech?"

bra.2.t:0 "The AIB gain power in Parliament!"
bra.2.d:0 "After the scenes at São Paulo less than a month ago, the Integralist movements who took to the city appear to have been swept up by the all-encompassing Ação Integralista Brasileira. This party is making more demands in parliament by the day, believing themselves the only ones fit to run the country. Even though they call proudly call themselves fascist, it opens the question. Can we tar all movements like this with the German brush?"
bra.2.a:0 "Yes, it's Nazism through and through! Shut them down!"
bra.2.b:0 "No, censoring them would make us no better than tyrants."
